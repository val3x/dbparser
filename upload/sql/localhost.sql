Jonathan VanSchaack, director of the web division of <a href=\"http://www.remcom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Remly Communications</a>, offered to fill us in on some of the details behind what happened to NodeKi&#8217;s customers before the collapse of the company. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had the opportunity to purchase NodeKi clients that were actively paying.  We did express some interest in the Lifetime clients but we chose not to as any business plan that relies on 0 revenue long term is due to fail. That being said we sent our own letter out to the paying customers of NodeKi letting them know we will be migrating them to our servers in the long term but also keeping their servers active.  We felt we could provide superior services along with great support to those clients. </p></blockquote>\n<p>VanSchaack said that he purchased the customers directly from NodeKi and not the InterQuad holding company. As <a href=\"http://www.remcom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Remly</a> has been in business for 11 years and offers managed hosting for WordPress and other CMS platforms, they felt that it was a great fit. &#8220;Remly purchased the clients for expansion,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We are in a growth area of our business now that we feel infrastructure is at a very stable point.&#8221; </p>\n<p>When asked how he became aware that NodeKi was wanting to sell off all of its customers, VanSchaack said that he was informed of the sale opportunity by a broker:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The current owner was looking for a home for the customers that would give similar support and offerings. To be honest his asking price was far below market value. As in my opinion, he was trying to find the right place for the customers he could move.  We looked at the lifetime clients but did not feel they fit into our business plan.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>An Offer For Displaced Lifetime Customers</h3>\n<p>Remly Hosting is offering a three month free trial matching the top lifetime plan NodeKi offered for those customer who have been displaced. This includes migration services for cPanel to cPanel transfers. VanSchaack has already been in contact with the owner and says that he is willing to give access to client accounts where permission is given by the customer. The plan includes a comparable set of resources previously provided by NodeKi, in terms of disk space, bandwidth, databases, additional domains. </p>\n<p>After the three months, former NodeKi customers can elect to break away from the hosting or transition to one of Remly&#8217;s paid Managed WordPress plans starting at $12.95 a month. VanSchaack said, &#8220;<strong>Our goal is to help customers that might be having issues on such a short notice but also show them our services are the same if not better than NodeKi and to stick with us long term.</strong>&#8221; Any NodeKi customers who are interested can email <a href=\"mailto:sales@remly.com\">sales@remly.com</a> or open a support ticket under the NodeKi account and Remly will get involved. </p>\n<p>The lesson to consumers here is that no lifetime plan is ever guaranteed to last a lifetime, and may not even be available for the lifetime of the company. Customers can be bought and sold at any time. When you&#8217;re looking for a WordPress host, it&#8217;s good to do a little background research into the stability of the company, especially if it is new and offering deals that might seem too good to be true.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 22:23:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Trac Features Have Been Ported to bbPress and BuddyPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14720\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:204:\"http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-trac-features-have-been-ported-to-bbpress-and-buddypress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-wordpress-trac-features-have-been-ported-to-bbpress-and-buddypress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3078:\"<p>So far, 2014 is the year for making over <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Trac</a>. Over the past couple weeks and during the holidays, Andrew Nacin has implemented a host of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements\" target=\"_blank\">new features</a> that make it easier for contributors to collaborate with one another, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adds-per-ticket-notifications-to-trac\" target=\"_blank\">get better ticket notifications</a> and work more efficiently with new reports and keywords for sorting tickets.</p>\n<p>Yesterday Nacin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2014/01/15/trac-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> that he has now ported over most of these new features to other tracs hosted on WordPress.org (meta, bbPress, BuddyPress, GlotPress, themes and plugins), including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use WP.org cookie authentication, SSL and refreshed design</li>\n<li>bbPress and BuddyPress now have their own skins</li>\n<li>Image attachment previews in tickets</li>\n<li>Email address syncing</li>\n<li>IRC cross-references for #wordpress-meta, #buddypress-dev, #bbpress-dev, #glotpress, #wordpress-gsoc</li>\n<li>Lots of bug fixes and tweaks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember those pale yellow colored tickets? Trac is looking much better with projects using their own skins:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/buddypress-trac.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14720]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/buddypress-trac.png\" alt=\"buddypress-trac\" width=\"1500\" height=\"926\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14863\" /></a></p>\n<p>As BuddyPress, bbPress and other large projects use trac in a similar way to WordPress, it only makes sense that the new features would be ported over. It be awesome to have the same ticket-starring and per-ticket notifications features that have been added to the WordPress trac. Nacin said that these features are on their way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Notifications are coming very soon to BuddyPress, bbPress, GlotPress, and meta. Probably in the next few days. Once a Trac is running the new notifications feature, that means it has been migrated to MySQL, which means the data is more accessible to the rest of WP.org, as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nacin has also been experimenting with design/functionality of the plugins trac, which is looking pretty snazzy already:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/plugin-trac.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14720]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/plugin-trac.png\" alt=\"plugin-trac\" width=\"1571\" height=\"1309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14872\" /></a></p>\n<p>He&#8217;s still working to add links from the plugin directory to these new pages, which could make things interesting for plugin authors. He also plans to add per-plugin notifications where committers will be subscribed by default.

The theme is fully responsive, based on <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a> and features a grid style. This super light theme includes only two images and is fully customizable via CSS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fullby.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14689]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fullby.jpg\" alt=\"fullby\" width=\"800\" height=\"371\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14808\" /></a></p>\n<p>If the design looks familiar, it&#8217;s because it was inspired by <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Fourteen</a>. However, it&#8217;s not a child theme. Unlike Twenty Fourteen, Fullby is a fluid theme that expands to use all the available space on any screen, including desktop, mobile, tablet and larger screens.</p>\n<h4>Fullby Features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gallery and Video Support &#8211; easily copy and paste a Youtube ID to publish.</li>\n<li>Fluid, modular and responsive grid style for posts</li>\n<li>Built with Bootstrap and Font Awesome &#8211; 369 icons available</li>\n<li>Featured Header Content &#8211; add &#8220;featured&#8221; content to header by using the &#8220;featured&#8221; tag in the post</li>\n<li>2 Menus and 2 Sidebars</li>\n<li>Popular and Latest Post Widget\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every aspect of this theme shows attention to detail, including category pages, widgets and date-based archives.

I assumed that there would be quite a bit of configuring to get it to look anything like the demo but was pleasantly surprised. There are no design-related options to tinker with. Further customization, however, will require some CSS knowledge.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a lean blogging or magazine style theme that is based on Bootstrap, then Fullby is a strong option.

This tag will be used to identify tickets that are good starting points for new contributors. In my opinion, this is one of the most important changes to trac we have seen in a long time. Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8216\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/482.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8216\" alt=\"WCSF Contributor Day\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/482-500x373.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WCSF Contributor Day</p></div>\n<p>Near the end of the meeting, a number of people shared their stories of how they contributed to WordPress for the first time. Some people used the contributor day at WordCamp San Francisco to create their first patch or ticket while another did the same at WordCamp Orlando. When <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/my-first-ever-wordcamp-san-francisco-experience\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/my-first-ever-wordcamp-san-francisco-experience\">I attended the WordCamp San Francisco contributor day</a> 2013, I was able to create a ticket for a longstanding issue I&#8217;ve had with the WordPress Media Library. Without the help of Mika Epstein as a mentor, I wouldn&#8217;t have been comfortable enough to <a title=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24859\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24859\">create the ticket</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TracIntimidation.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14815\" alt=\"Trac Intimidation\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TracIntimidation-500x265.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"265\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Intimidation Factor</h3>\n<p>I was asked by Andrew Nacin why I felt <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">trac</a> was intimidating. I consider trac to be a place where all the magic happens. It&#8217;s where you need to know diff files, ticket numbers, code, etc. It&#8217;s not something a common end-user would be comfortable in navigating. To me, trac is an entirely new world that I&#8217;ve always been too nervous to enter. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in fearing trac or being intimated by it and thus, not contributing to WordPress in that way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_14816\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoodFirstBug.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-14816\" alt=\"Good First Bug\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoodFirstBug-500x315.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/guitavares/1703252007/\">gui.tavares</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>This is why I think the <em>&#8220;good-first-bug&#8221;</em> tag is so important. When someone new to trac picks those tickets to work on as their first, the expectation is for mistakes to happen. If a new contributor screws up a diff file or does something else wrong, it will be ok because it&#8217;s expected behavior. It takes a lot of stress off of the new contributor and creates a learning environment without the fear of screwing things up for everyone else.</p>\n<h3>They&#8217;re Not Angry, I Just Think They Might Be</h3>\n<p>I was then asked where the line of thinking comes from that results in me thinking that a developer might be “angry”? Are people giving off that impression? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the impression those participating on trac are giving off but rather, an unnecessary fear I have. The fear in trac is doing something wrong, angering a developer, wasting their time, and making mistakes. I&#8217;ve never seen a public trac discussion where developers are yelling at newcomers for making dumb mistakes. Just the possibility of making established contributors angry is enough to prevent me from participating in that community. It&#8217;s an unnecessary tension that I think a lot of people feel.</p>\n<h3>Plenty Of People To Guide Me</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GuideMe.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14820\" alt=\"Guide Me Compass\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GuideMe-500x269.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thankfully, I was reassured from multiple people that I don&#8217;t need to feel the way I do and that there are plenty of people willing to stop what they&#8217;re doing to help guide me in the right direction. One of them was Andrew Nacin, one of the lead developers for WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please never worry about angering a developer or doing something wrong or wasting someone&#8217;s time. I get angry at developers who get angry with contributors and if you ever do get the impression you&#8217;ve annoyed someone or are doing something wrong, anyone is always welcome to ping me privately and I&#8217;m happy to A) talk to you about it and walk you through it, and B) privately talk to any contributors who *are* causing problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What Andrew states is a sentiment that most in the WordPress Development IRC channel share. The fears that I have of screwing up are a large reason why I&#8217;m a huge fan of one-to-one mentorship. An individual who can help me through the ticket/patch process without fear of looking like a fool in front of established contributors. While there is an initiative to get a list of mentors put together, it will be awhile before something official is put in place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPMentorFeaturedImage1.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14106\" alt=\"WPMentor Featured Image\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPMentorFeaturedImage1-500x207.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"207\" /></a></p>\n<p>What I&#8217;ve seen at contributor days at WordCamps proves to me that a WordPress mentorship program would substantially increase the amount of first time contributors. It&#8217;s not about having my hand-held as I go through the process but rather, helping to build my confidence level to a point where I&#8217;m comfortable enough to go through the process on my own. Helen brought up a great point in the conversation. If you don&#8217;t have access to commit code to the core of WordPress that millions of people will use, then there should be no reason to fear the actions of creating tickets or submitting patches.</p>\n<h3>Contributing To WordPress For The First Time</h3>\n<p>When I <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too\">contributed a patch to WordPress for the first time</a>, it was an exhilarating experience. Talk about an adrenaline rush! After I saw my name in the credits portion to help make WordPress 3.8 a reality, I wanted to learn everything there was to know about PHP and contribute to WordPress full-time. Of course, reality soon sunk in but it was an awesome experience. My hope is that the tickets labeled with the tag <em>&#8220;good-first-bug&#8221;</em> are blessed so when a person uses them to get their first patch into core, they will experience the same adrenaline rush I did and consider becoming a regular patch contributor to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;ll Need Thick Skin</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14821\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThickSkin.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14791]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-14821\" alt=\"You\'ll Need Thick Skin\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThickSkin-500x332.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/uberzombie/1029296894/\">uberzombie</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Not every patch makes it to core. Some of them are discarded and when it comes to using trac to contribute, you&#8217;ll need a thick skin and be able to accept defeat. However, those experiences build character and just because a patch is denied, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s game over. It&#8217;s important to note that while most of this article is dedicated to contributing to WordPress through trac, there are many other ways to contribute. As Helen noted in the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are things beyond patches that are extremely valuable, and in some cases even more valuable. Great bug reports, reproducing elusive bugs, testing patches, refreshing patches, commenting on tickets so people don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re left hanging, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far, the best guide I&#8217;ve seen on the topic of contributing to WordPress was <a title=\"http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/10/contributing-to-wordpress/\" href=\"http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/10/contributing-to-wordpress/\">published by Siobhan McKeown</a>. While it&#8217;s from May of 2013, it does an excellent job of showcasing all of the different parts of the project that people can contribute to.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>My main take away from the WordPress developers chat is that my fear of navigating trac and contributing to WordPress through code is unwarranted. There are plenty of people willing to stop on a dime and help me through the process. All I need to do is ask. I also learned that getting new people to contribute through trac has become one of the top priorities for WordPress core developers.</p>\n<p>So far, trac has undergone a number of changes that reflect that train of thought and there are more to come. Thanks to improvements like the addition of the <em>&#8220;good-first-bug&#8221;</em>, trac doesn&#8217;t have to be such an intimidating place to begin contributing to WordPress through code. Trac is not a fraternity, it&#8217;s not a place where only the elite of WordPress programmers reside. Trac is just a tool to help improve WordPress, nothing more. <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/i-contributed-to-the-core-of-wordpress-and-you-can-too\">I contributed to the core of WordPress and you can too!</a></p>\n<p><em>Credit for the title of this post goes to <strong><a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/shelob9\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/shelob9\">shelob9</a></strong> also known as Josh Pollock from the WordPress development chat.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 17:21:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Aesop Storytelling Engine Launches Crowdfunding Campaign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14827\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:176:\"http://wptavern.com/aesop-storytelling-engine-launches-crowdfunding-campaign?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=aesop-storytelling-engine-launches-crowdfunding-campaign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2820:\"<p>Last week Nick Haskins introduced his <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/aesop-story-engine-an-open-source-wordpress-plugin-for-storytelling\" target=\"_blank\">open source storytelling plugin</a> for WordPress. The proof of concept allows publishers to create big, visual posts with multimedia storytelling tools built right into the WordPress post editor. The New York Times showcased this trend in its feature <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/12/30/year-in-interactive-storytelling/\" target=\"_blank\">2013: The Year in Interactive Storytelling</a>. The trouble is, before Aesop arrived on the scene, creating posts in story format required quite a bit of custom work in order to make it easy for publishers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/story.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14827]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/story.png\" alt=\"story\" width=\"1600\" height=\"993\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14014\" /></a></p>\n<p>Haskins has now launched a crowdfunding campaign to help him take the fully working beta and make it a reality for more people to use. He believes that Aesop is an important project that can fundamentally change how publishers build stories: </p>\n<blockquote><p>We have entered an age where publishers are seeking new methods of keeping readers engaged. We are already witnessing story, after story, after story, after story being released that really push the boundaries of what the web can do. And, we are reading that it takes 16 people 6 months to create these things. Not with Aesop. The engine can be used by anybody, without any code, and you can build stories by yourself, within minutes. All for free, fully GPL, within WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The $15,000 he&#8217;s raising will go towards forming a business, finishing the <a href=\"http://aesopstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hosted version of Aesop</a>, hiring another developer to help improve the plugin, and a few other odds and ends required for getting it officially launched. </p>\n<p>If Aesop reaches its stretch goal of $20,000, Haskins plans to run a &#8220;Theme Bounty,&#8221; to offer monetary rewards for themes that incorporate Aesop Story Engine. He also plans to establish an Aesop Marketplace for themes built just for Aesop.</p>\n<p>Check out Haskin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://playground.aesopstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">live demos</a> if you want to see what he&#8217;s created, or <a href=\"https://github.com/bearded-avenger/aesop-core\" target=\"_blank\">download the plugin</a> for yourself to take it for a test drive.

American developers may want to do their taxes early, because the 3.9 release schedule will be keeping everyone busy. Tentative <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">dates</a> for the 4.0 and 4.1 releases are mid-August and early December, respectively.</p>\n<p>The second order of business during the regularly scheduled WordPress dev meeting this week was to discuss <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">feature plugins</a> that might be in the mix for 3.9. </p>\n<h3>Possible Feature Plugins for 3.9</h3>\n<p>Shaun Andrews mentioned that the Widgets UI Refresh team is working on the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-future-of-wordpress-widgets-a-better-ui-with-real-time-previews\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Customizer</a> and believes it will be ready for 3.9. The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Customizer</a> plugin offers live previews of widgets while you edit them and is available on WordPress.org if you&#8217;d like to help test it.</p>\n<p>Shaun Andrews&#8217; <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-widgets\" target=\"_blank\">Better Widgets</a> plugin may also have enough momentum to make it into the 3.9 merge. These two widget-related plugins were the only ones mentioned in the meeting that might be ready for the feature review and merge process in 3.9, which should happen at the end of January into early February. The plugins are not guaranteed to be in 3.9 but they do have strong possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Iterative Enhancements for Existing Features</h3>\n<p>In addition to feature plugins, Nacin also identified a few areas where WordPress 3.9 could stand to iterate on previous releases: &#8220;<strong>Things like audio/video, even the theme browsing experience to the theme installer, are iterative and could totally take place in 3.9.</strong>&#8221; This is important because we can&#8217;t always focus on building shiny new features without looping back around to improve the ones we already have.</p>\n<p>The development meeting concluded with a brainstorming session on how to make it easier for people to contribute to WordPress.

The notifications use the new Apple Push Notifications service to notify users of new events. Since the feature was added to OS X Mavericks, there have been a number of services built around it. <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/roost-for-bloggers/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/roost-for-bloggers/\">Roost For Bloggers</a> is one such service. However, the one I&#8217;m reviewing today is called <a title=\"http://pushmonkey.launchrock.com/\" href=\"http://pushmonkey.launchrock.com/\">Push Monkey</a> by <a title=\"http://mowowstudios.com/\" href=\"http://mowowstudios.com/\">moWOW studios</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PushMonkeySubscribeNotice.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14526]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14756\" alt=\"Push Monkey Subscription Notice\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PushMonkeySubscribeNotice-500x184.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>\n<p>When Push Monkey is activated on the site and the domain is registered within the system, those who are using Mac OS X Mavericks and Safari 7 will see a notice asking if they would like to subscribe. Once subscribed to the site, they will receive new notifications each time a post is published. If the visitor chooses not the subscribe, they won&#8217;t be asked again. Posts that are already published or edited after being published will not generate a notification. Safari is used only for the initial subscription to the site. After that, notifications are received even when Safari is closed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PushMonkeySiteNotification.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14526]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14757\" alt=\"Push Monkey Site Notification\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PushMonkeySiteNotification-500x158.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"158\" /></a></p>\n<p>Tudor Munteanu, one of the developers behind Push Monkey told me that while Safari is the only way to see the subscription notice, they have plans for more custom integration similar to <a title=\"http://www.macrumors.com/\" href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/\">Macrumors</a>. The reason why it&#8217;s not part of the initial offering is because it&#8217;s heavily dependent on the websites visual identity. Push Monkey is currently in the alpha stage of development with plans to have it finished by the end of this month. When I asked whether Push Monkey would be free to use, Tudor responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It will most likely be a paid service. We do have some price points in mind, but the final values are not crystal clear. What we do know is that this price point is slightly under what we saw similar services asked for in the past. On top of that, for developers who have contacts to content publishers, we plan to have a very generous affiliate system.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Choices Are Abundant But I Have Questions</h3>\n<p>During the time I&#8217;ve reviewed Push Monkey, I&#8217;ve received three other requests to review similar plugins and services. I didn&#8217;t realize there was so much demand for something that caters to a select demographic of website visitors. I don&#8217;t understand what the benefits are to using this notification system versus RSS, or something like <a title=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\">PubHubSubHub</a> combined with the <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/pushpress/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/pushpress/\">PuSHPress</a> plugin. The question I have for website owners is why would you cater to a specific audience instead of focusing on enabling anyone on any device to be able to receive real-time updates?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 21:33:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Official Git Mirror Now Available for WordPress Core Development Repository\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14741\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:214:\"http://wptavern.com/official-git-mirror-now-available-for-wordpress-core-development-repository?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=official-git-mirror-now-available-for-wordpress-core-development-repository\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4560:\"<p>Andrew Nacin <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/15/git-mirrors-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> official git mirrors for WordPress this afternoon on the WordPress make/core development blog. These are read-only mirrors that correspond to the WordPress core development SVN repository. Git mirrors are also now available for BuddyPress, bbPress, GlotPress and the old core.svn “build” repository:</p>\n<pre>git clone git://develop.git.wordpress.org/\ngit clone git://buddypress.git.wordpress.org/\ngit clone git://bbpress.git.wordpress.org/\ngit clone git://core.git.wordpress.org/\ngit clone git://glotpress.git.wordpress.org/</pre>\n<p>Needless to say, developers who contribute to WordPress and/or its major ancillary projects are thrilled:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Official GIt Mirrors for WordPress: <a href=\"http://t.co/nJUi3yK4EP\">http://t.co/nJUi3yK4EP</a> Can I get a Hallelujah?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Mike Schinkel (@mikeschinkel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeschinkel/statuses/423527837736255488\">January 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Read make/core post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin\">@nacin</a>.

Something to discuss in a few months, I imagine.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The current git contribution process is not quite as direct, but Nacin cites Scribu&#8217;s tutorial on <a href=\"http://scribu.net/wordpress/contributing-to-wordpress-using-github.html\" target=\"_blank\">Contributing To WordPress Using Github</a> as a place to get started.</p>\n<h3>Future Mirrors for Plugin and Theme Repositories</h3>\n<p>At the end of his announcement post, Nacin hints at the possibility of making git mirrors available for WordPress plugins and themes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are a lot of other repositories on WordPress.org not yet mirrored. Notably: plugins and themes. These are massive multi-project repositories and will require a bit more investment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An undertaking like this has the potential to please many more developers, as those who contribute to the WordPress core are still a relatively small number compared to those with active extensions on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Is WordPress Moving Away From SVN?</h3>\n<p>Some of you might be wondering whether the new git mirrors are an indication that WordPress will eventually abandon SVN entirely in favor of git somewhere further down the road. That doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case, as Nacin replied on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/15/git-mirrors-for-wordpress/#comment-12428\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> to his post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you or your tools want to use Git, you should be able to. If you or your tools want to use SVN, you should be able to. You could think of it as a desire to be VCS agnostic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I interviewed Nacin briefly to ask him if the project is committed to keeping both version control options available in the future. He confirmed that SVN is going nowhere anytime soon but rather that the project is committed to letting developers choose:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re definitely committed to keeping both options available. Some developers are simply more used to X, or find X simpler, or find X cryptic/convoluted/difficult. I use both daily. With both options available, developers can use what they are most comfortable with or what fits best with their project, client, or company. There&#8217;s no need to force everyone to pick one, and there are a lot of tools and scripts people already use to interact with these SVN repositories, too. It just doesn&#8217;t make sense to not mirror between them for the long term.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For the next week it will be in beta, so there may be a few bugs that need to be ironed out. Hopefully, these new git mirrors will open up the doors for contributors to push more enhancements and fixes to the WordPress project. Given the massive popularity of git, we may look back to this time as a pivotal moment. For right now, suffice to say that these new git mirrors just made a ton of WordPress developers very happy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 21:19:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Google Releases Its First Plugin For WordPress Publishers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:178:\"http://wptavern.com/google-releases-its-first-plugin-for-wordpress-publishers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-releases-its-first-plugin-for-wordpress-publishers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4209:\"<p>Google released its first plugin for self-hosted WordPress sites today. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Publisher</a> is now in beta and available on WordPress.org. The WordPress community is invited to test it out.</p>\n<p>So far, the plugin includes two main features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily add AdSense ads to your site to make money from advertising.</li>\n<li>Verify your site with Webmaster Tools with just one click.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tested the plugin this morning so we could take a tour. Even though they&#8217;re calling this a beta, it seems to work fairly smoothly out of the box.</p>\n<h3>Quick Tour of the Google Publisher Plugin</h3>\n<p>After installing Google Publisher, I found its options under <strong>Settings >> Google Publisher</strong>. Naturally, you&#8217;re going to need to sign in with Google to use it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/google-publisher.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14707]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/google-publisher.jpg\" alt=\"google-publisher\" width=\"715\" height=\"322\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14713\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Verify With Google Webmaster Tools in 1 Click</h4>\n<p>Perhaps the most appealing feature of this plugin is the ability to get your site verified with Google Webmaster with just one click. For years we&#8217;ve seen tutorials about how to integrate Google AdSense and Webmaster Tools with WordPress. This plugin provides the easiest way I&#8217;ve seen so far to get your site verified by Google Webmaster Tools. There are no codes to add to your site and no lengthy verification process. Google makes it very convenient; simply authenticate and then you&#8217;re verified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/verified1.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14707]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/verified1.jpg\" alt=\"verified\" width=\"676\" height=\"342\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14735\" /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8216;manage&#8217; button that you see ensures that you are always just one click away from viewing the Google Webmaster Tools dashboard for your site. From there you can easily check on crawl errors, search queries, find out who links to you, submit a sitemap and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/webmaster-tools1.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14707]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/webmaster-tools1.jpg\" alt=\"webmaster-tools\" width=\"1002\" height=\"490\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14739\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Click to Place Google AdSense Ads</h4>\n<p>Since I don&#8217;t participate in AdSense, I wasn&#8217;t able to test drive that portion. However, the plugin&#8217;s details page gives you a good idea of what this feature includes. Google Publisher provides an interactive way to place ads in your page templates by simply clicking:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/click-to-add-google-adsense.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14707]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/click-to-add-google-adsense.png\" alt=\"click-to-add-google-adsense\" width=\"1024\" height=\"670\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14724\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also preview example advertisements alongside your content before placing them there:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/preview.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14707]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/preview.png\" alt=\"preview\" width=\"1024\" height=\"670\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14725\" /></a></p>\n<p>Please be advised that the plugin is in beta and the Google development team is still fine-tuning it to work with publishers&#8217; needs. It will be interesting to see how well Google supports its first WordPress plugin. Will Google provide support on WordPress.org or will it limit support to the Google help center? Will they pack this plugin full of new features for publishers further down the road? Only time will tell.

Putting everything in the customizer is a growing trend among WordPress theme developers, although many just provide a handful of basic options. That&#8217;s why I appreciate the fact that Blogly also adds the ability to upload a site logo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/logo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14680]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/logo.png\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"613\" height=\"512\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14682\" /></a></p>\n<p>So far Blogly is one of the most comprehensive themes when it comes to building options into WordPress&#8217; customizer. Dale says he&#8217;s committed to building themes like this in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I like the change in approach away from a dedicated options panel, the theme should be a lot easier to customize visually with the theme customizer and I will be doing all my themes this way in future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://themefurnace.com/themes/?theme=Blogly\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see Blogly in action or take it for a spin on your own site.

The NodeKi management team sent out an email to all of their customers today to inform them of the situation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Sir/Madam,<br />\nAs of February 1st, 2014, NodeKi will permanently be going out of business. We want to inform you in advance that the NodeKi lifetime plans and server will cease to exist on Feburary 1st of 2014.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the “Lifetime” plans were not a sustainable business model. We can’t continue paying for servers, software, bandwidth and support if there’s no incoming money to cover these costs. It’s not remotely possible to provide any product “for life” that has recurring costs associated with it. The Lifetime plans were not something that the existing management implemented, sold, or received money for. Due to this reason and the “no refund” policy at purchase, we are not able to offer refunds. This is not something that is open to debate.</p>\n<p>LIMITED support (password resets and MINOR server related issues) will be provided on a best effort basis up until the shut down time. We have provided a two week timeframe so that you can move your domains and websites to a new provider.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support in the previous years.</p>\n<p>Respectfully,<br />\nNodeKi Management</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year after NodeKi launched its new plans, it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danbutcher/status/324504968201641984\" target=\"_blank\">bought out</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IQCorp\" target=\"_blank\">InterQuad corporation</a>, a holding company for other brands, leaving some to wonder if this was planned from the outset. Prior to that NodeKi had launched with Lifetime WordPress Hosting packages starting at just $39.00 USD, which were offered as an early bird discount. Customers who originally purchased NodeKi&#8217;s Lifetime Plan are <a href=\"http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/never-buy-hosting-again-nodeki-offers-lifetime-wordpress-hosting-plans/#comment-147361\" target=\"_blank\">furious</a>. They were promised that they would never have to buy WordPress hosting again and paid the extra cost for lifetime service. </p>\n<p>Using the Internet Archive, I was able to find an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120331214929/http://my.nodeki.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\">archived page</a> of their original <a href=\"http://my.nodeki.com/cart.php?gid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Lifetime plan pricing structure</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lifetime-plans.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14655]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lifetime-plans.jpg\" alt=\"lifetime-plans\" width=\"746\" height=\"642\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14661\" /></a></p>\n<h3>What Went Wrong at NodeKi?</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no shortage of demand for managed WordPress hosting in the WordPress ecosystem. GoDaddy will be launching a managed WordPress product this week and managed WordPress host <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/2014/01/14/wp-engine-raises-15-million-accelerate-growth-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Engine just scooped up $15 million dollars</a> in venture capital today to help fund the company&#8217;s rapid growth. </p>\n<p>What caused NodeKi to shut down? The email hints at a major problem with its pricing structure. If NodeKi collapsed under the weight of its profitless lifetime hosting plans, that seems to indicate that there wasn&#8217;t a huge demand for the recurring plans that were subsequently released. Monetarily, it&#8217;s not a huge loss for a customer, but it is a major disappointment and inconvenience for those who put their faith in the company&#8217;s long term vision. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 23:46:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Easily Add Buttons, Boxes, and Columns To Content With These 3 WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14615\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:220:\"http://wptavern.com/easily-add-buttons-boxes-and-columns-to-content-with-these-3-wordpress-plugins?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=easily-add-buttons-boxes-and-columns-to-content-with-these-3-wordpress-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3609:\"<p>While browsing the <a title=\"http://themehybrid.com/\" href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">ThemeHybrid</a> support forums, I came across an individual who shared a project he was working on called <a title=\"http://wp-editor.com/\" href=\"http://wp-editor.com/\">WP-Editor</a>. While the plugin is not called WP-Editor, there are three plugins that make up the project that enhance the visual editor of WordPress. They are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>WP Editor Boxes Add-on</li>\n<li>WP Editor Buttons Add-on</li>\n<li>WP Editor Columns Add-on</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>WP Editor Boxes</h3>\n<p>This plugin contains four different styles of boxes that can be applied around content to be used as visual cues. The styles displayed in the following screenshot are <strong>Notes, Alert, Error, and Download</strong>. The colors match up well with their intended meaning. To apply a box style, highlight the content within the visual editor and select the box style from the dropdown menu. You can use the text editor but you&#8217;ll need to know the class names that make up the box style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorDownloadBox.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14615]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14646\" alt=\"WP Editor Download Boxes\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorDownloadBox-500x184.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>\n<h3>WP Editor Buttons</h3>\n<p>This plugin has five different button styles. <strong>White, Black, Red, Green, and Blue</strong>. Creating a button is as simple as highlighting the text that will be linked and applying a button style using the dropdown menu. This is the easiest way I&#8217;ve discovered to add a button to a post short of using an image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorButtons.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14615]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14647\" alt=\"WP Editor Buttons\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorButtons-500x31.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"31\" /></a></p>\n<h3>WP Editor Columns</h3>\n<p>Instead of using CSS tricks or class names that are difficult to remember, Editor Columns provides up to four different ways to display columns. You can display 1/2 by 1/2, 1/3 by 2/3, 2/3 by 1/3, or 1/3 by 1/3 by 1/3. Using columns is easy but sometimes I found myself screwing up the content and having to start over. I think this would go away after using the plugin for an extensive period of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorColumns.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14615]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14649\" alt=\"WP Editor Columns\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WPEditorColumns-346x500.jpg\" width=\"346\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Although you can use the text editor, these plugins are to be used primarily within the visual editor. In fact, you won&#8217;t see any of the drop down menus when the text editor is being used. However, if you know the class names by memory or have them in a document, you can use those instead.</p>\n<p>Despite the WP Editor project being a work in progress, I found the three plugins that are currently available easy to use without needing a manual to get me started. While many themes provide the same functionality through the use of shortcodes, if a user were to switch themes, those styles would disappear. By using a plugin to add these visual elements, users are safe to switch themes without losing the look of their styled content. These plugins are a solid way to easily add visual punch to otherwise boring text.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 23:05:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Data.gov Is Using WordPress and All the Code is Open Source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14521\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:182:\"http://wptavern.com/data-gov-is-using-wordpress-and-all-the-code-is-open-source?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=data-gov-is-using-wordpress-and-all-the-code-is-open-source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5451:\"<p>The US Government&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Data.gov</a> website is a beautiful implementation of WordPress.

The site also features a blog for posting updates on available datasets and a section for <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/cities/\" target=\"_blank\">cities</a> to participate in sharing their data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/data-dot-gov.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14521]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/data-dot-gov.jpg\" alt=\"data-dot-gov\" width=\"1257\" height=\"1312\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14622\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Open Source Code Behind Data.gov</h3>\n<p>The code for the Data.gov website is licensed under GPL v2 or later and is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/GSA/data.gov\" target=\"_blank\">GSA github account</a>. However, github is only used for source version control for the WordPress theme code. The site is actually powered by two open source projects &#8211; <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"http://ckan.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CKAN</a>. The <a href=\"http://catalog.data.gov/dataset\" target=\"_blank\">data catalog</a> portion of the site utilizes <a href=\"http://ckan.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CKAN</a>, a popular data portal platform.</p>\n<p>Data.gov uses a modified version of the <a href=\"http://roots.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Roots Theme</a>. All of the plugins the site uses are available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/tree/master/plugins\" target=\"_blank\">/plugins/</a> folder. In the <a href=\"https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/tree/master/exportable\" target=\"_blank\">/exportable/</a> directory you will find advanced custom fields definitions in xml format that can be imported manually via the acf plugin. The development team also plans to release the configuration for installing and deploying the Data.gov WordPress portion of the code using <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress CLI</a>.</p>\n<h3>Mobile  and Web Apps Based on City Data</h3>\n<p>One of the particularly interesting sections of Data.gov is its showcase of <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/cities/page/city-apps\" target=\"_blank\">city applications</a>. Developers have created hundreds of apps based on government data. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/apps.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14521]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/apps.jpg\" alt=\"apps\" width=\"882\" height=\"409\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14637\" /></a></p>\n<p>The mobile apps span a wide range of utilities and are powered by government data. A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.veloracks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VeloRacks</a> &#8211; A free app for finding bike racks around Seattle</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://towtext.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TowText</a> &#8211; An app powered by <a href=\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Towed-Vehicles/ygr5-vcbg\" target=\"_blank\">City of Chicago data</a> to help people find missing cards that may have been towed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/raids-online-mobile/id496011979\" target=\"_blank\">RAIDS Online</a> &#8211; A free crime mapping app powered by the City of Lexington data to help improve public safety</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sdi-apps.com/download-the-app-here/\" target=\"_blank\">City of Albuquerque</a>- Free app with news, latest issues and coupons for local events, powered by Albuquerque city data</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sfpark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SFpark</a> &#8211; Check parking availability and pricing from your phone, powered by San Francisco city data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>City data also powers a wide range of web applications, including <a href=\"http://www.atmos.washington.edu/SPU/\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle Rain Watch</a>, <a href=\"http://cpstiers.opencityapps.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Public School Tiers</a>, a <a href=\"http://clearstreets.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Plow Tracker</a> for Chicago and several more.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing what people and cities can do when governments make data available for anyone to use. If you want to help get your city involved, you can <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact data.gov</a> and they will actually send the message to your city official.</p>\n<h3>Open Source and Open Data Working Together</h3>\n<p>Data.gov is an excellent example of a government putting open source software to good use and is part of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data\" target=\"_blank\">open data movement</a>. Data.gov.uk is a similar <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">site</a> that is powered by Drupal. The open movement is predicated on the belief that any data collected by the government belongs to its people and aims to give citizens digital access to this data.

This marked a turning point in BuddyPress history and meant that sites no longer required a BuddyPress-specific theme. Prior to 1.7, use of the plugin depended on having a BP-enabled theme. Developers had to do quite a bit of work to theme markup and CSS in order to ensure BuddyPress compatibility. </p>\n<p>The BuddyPress 1.7 about page included a &#8220;<strong>Declaration of (Theme) Independence</strong>,&#8221; stating that BuddyPress was now compatible with all WordPress themes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/theme-independence.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14507]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/theme-independence.jpg\" alt=\"theme-independence\" width=\"1037\" height=\"507\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14509\" /></a></p>\n<p>These changes brought BuddyPress more in line with how WordPress loads templates. It works much the same way as bbPress &#8211; where you can simply drop the plugin into your site and it takes on the look of your active theme. As a result of theme compatibility, it seemed that it was no longer important for theme authors to specify if their themes were compatible with BuddyPress. After all, aren&#8217;t all themes now compatible?</p>\n<h3>Not All WordPress Themes Use WordPress&#8217;s Template Loader</h3>\n<p>The reality is that not all WordPress themes follow the WordPress core template loading approach, as <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5301#comment:6\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> by Boone in response to a recent ticket on the subject.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer John James Jacoby <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/support/topic/buddypress-stopped-working-with-thesis-on-upgrade-from-1-8-to-1-9/#post-176727\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on a related thread, indicating that BuddyPress cannot guarantee support for theme frameworks that bypasses WordPress&#8217; template loader with its own:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Previous to 1.9 we were purposely doing it wrong for the sake of maximum compatibility. In 1.9, we fixed up a few things, that now uncover pretty fatal flaws in several themes. I’m torn, but I think it’s up to theme authors to decide their level of plugin compatibility, rather than the other way around where theme authors would expect every plugin to adapt to their proprietary output system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Updates made in BuddyPress 1.9 have changed <em>bp_buffer_template_part()</em> calls to <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7386\" target=\"_blank\">return instead of echo contents</a>, which exposed some <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/support/topic/buddypress-stopped-working-with-thesis-on-upgrade-from-1-8-to-1-9/\" target=\"_blank\">issues with themes</a> as users started upgrading from 1.8 &#8211; 1.9. Reverting that back for the sake of theme compatibility wasn&#8217;t a good option. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, BuddyPress developer @r-a-y submitted a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7736\" target=\"_blank\">potential fix</a> which was then committed to the trunk this morning. This <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5301/5301.01.patch\" target=\"_blank\">patch</a> may be helpful for sites that need an immediate fix. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll see these changes in a minor release soon.</p>\n<h3>Stating Compatibility With Major Plugins</h3>\n<p>Small fixes like the one referenced above may not resolve all theme incompatibilities, as there are some super complex WordPress themes that utilize their own non-standard templating systems. Since commercial themes do not post their code publicly, there&#8217;s no way for the consumer to know what kind of templating engine is under the hood. </p>\n<p>Therefore, it would be helpful if theme authors could specifically state their theme&#8217;s compatibility with BuddyPress. Ensuring that your theme is BuddyPress compatible is far easier than it once was if you&#8217;re using <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; standard template loading</a>. In many cases the theme is already compatible and it&#8217;s just a matter of testing to confirm. It also wouldn&#8217;t hurt to test with other major plugins that have extensive user bases, such as bbPress, WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, etc. </p>\n<p>The bottom line is that plugins simply cannot support all WordPress themes, no matter how popular a theme or framework has become. The BuddyPress core team is doing everything they can to help maintain compatibility while continuing to move BuddyPress forward, but they will not be able to account for all themes. </p>\n<p>Since theme authors cannot be forced to state their compatibility with major WordPress plugins, the responsibility ulimately falls to the consumer. If you&#8217;re considering purchasing a WordPress theme with the intention of using it with BuddyPress or bbPress or another plugin, make sure to ask the theme author if it will be compatible before buying. This could save you quite a bit of hassle and frustration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:50:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Configure When WordPress Plugins Load With Plugin Organizer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:182:\"http://wptavern.com/configure-when-wordpress-plugins-load-with-plugin-organizer?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=configure-when-wordpress-plugins-load-with-plugin-organizer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5570:\"<p>Near the end of <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-133-does-your-plugin-suck\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-133-does-your-plugin-suck\">episode 133</a> of WordPress Weekly, <a title=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\" href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> mentioned a new plugin that caught his eye called <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-organizer/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-organizer/\">Plugin Organizer</a> developed by <a title=\"http://www.jsterup.com/\" href=\"http://www.jsterup.com/\">Jeff Sterup</a>. This plugin enables three specific functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the order that plugins load on your site</li>\n<li>Selectively disable plugins by any post type or WordPress managed URL</li>\n<li>Adds grouping to the plugins admin page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerPluginFilters.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14582]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14583\" alt=\"Plugin Organizer Plugin Filters\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerPluginFilters.jpg\" width=\"157\" height=\"125\" /></a>I tested the plugin on my local install of WordPress 3.9-alpha using the TwentyFourteen default theme. After the plugin was installed and activated, I noticed a new top-level menu with a new icon. The icon reminds me of Winamp but upon closer inspection, it&#8217;s a puzzle piece. Hopefully, the plugin author recreates the image as an SVG file so it looks better with the Midnight color scheme. I initially assumed that the settings to configure the plugin would be found within this top-level menu but instead, I had to browse to <strong>Settings &#8211; Plugin Organizer</strong>.</p>\n<p>From within the settings page, you can configure a number of attributes such as selective plugin loading, selective mobile plugin loading, admin areas, and whether or not the settings should be preserved when Plugin Organizer is deactivated. Two tasks have to be completed before being able to selectively load plugins. The first is that selective plugin loading must be enabled. Second, the <strong>PluginOrganizerMU.class.php</strong> file from <strong>/wp-content/plugins/plugin_organizer/lib</strong> has to be moved to a specific location before it will take effect. Even If you don&#8217;t have an mu-plugins folder you&#8217;ll need to create it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerSettingsPage.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14582]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14584\" alt=\"Plugin Organizer Settings Page\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerSettingsPage-500x369.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once that&#8217;s taken care of, if you browse to <strong>Plugin Filters &#8211; Global Plugins</strong>, you&#8217;ll see a simplified list of activated plugins on the site. Any plugins disabled from this page will be hidden across the entire site. The only way to see a plugin that is disabled globally is to specifically allow it on a post or page. Each post and page will have a new meta box where you can control which plugins load.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerPerPostSettings.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14582]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14586\" alt=\"Plugin Organizer Per Post Settings\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerPerPostSettings.jpg\" width=\"519\" height=\"374\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of my favorite features this plugin offers is the ability to create and manage plugin groups. From the plugin administration page, you can select multiple plugins to add or remove from groups. On my test site, I grouped five plugins together that were related to commenting and named the group, <strong>Commenting Plugins</strong>. While the plugin told me that the group had been created, you&#8217;ll have to perform a hard refresh on the page for the group to show up. I believe this is a bug as it should show up without having to refresh the page. Groups are a great thing as they make managing plugins more efficient.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerGroups.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14582]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14588\" alt=\"Plugin Organizer Groups\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PluginOrganizerGroups-500x289.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" /></a></p>\n<p>Changing the order in which plugins load is as easy as drag and drop. From the Plugins management page, each plugin has a blue up/down handle. This handle is used to drag plugins up and down the list to determine when they will load. In fact, the entire horizontal column for the plugin description acts as a handle which makes it a lot easier to drag and drop.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This plugin works as advertised. For those looking for another way to optimize your websites, this is a cool plugin. It&#8217;s also a great tool to use by itself to organize plugins into groups, especially if you have 20 or more plugins installed. The default behavior is for all plugins installed on a WordPress site to be loaded on every single page whether they are needed or not. Plugin Organizer does a great job of helping to tackle this problem. This plugin doesn&#8217;t have the prettiest interface but you&#8217;re able to get the job done. It may take some time to set up, especially if you need to configure multiple pages with specific configurations but the increase in site performance may justify the time spent.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:25:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: WP Updates Settings: An Admin UI For Configuring WordPress Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14562\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:194:\"http://wptavern.com/wp-updates-settings-an-admin-ui-for-configuring-wordpress-updates?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-updates-settings-an-admin-ui-for-configuring-wordpress-updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2977:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/updates.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14562]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/updates.png\" alt=\"updates\" width=\"800\" height=\"259\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14565\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most exciting features in <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-7-released-wordpress-now-updates-itself\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 3.7</a> was the ability for WordPress to stay up to date through automatic background updates.

I can’t imagine the common user knowing about shortcodes, post types, etc and factoring those into their decision on which theme to buy. As has been the case for a long time, choosing themes is like walking down the street looking at each storefront window to see which one looks best. Between all these dependencies with shortcodes, etc. someone could really screw themselves by investing time and money into a theme that does everything wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I feel like WordPress themes have gone through a giant cycle. A few years ago, themes contained awesome features that manipulated the display of content. Features that could have existed as plugins but were built into themes. Now we&#8217;re on the other side of the cycle where there is demand for theme developers to get rid of all the extra fat found within themes and to get back to the basics of the <strong>KISS</strong> principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). While progressing through the cycle the WordPress theme ecosystem has become filled with themes that make a consumers life a living nightmare.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThemeReviewGuidelines.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14542]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14544\" alt=\"Theme Review Guidelines\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ThemeReviewGuidelines-500x394.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>Justin Tadlock is doing his part to change things for the better.

But themes hosted on WordPress.org are just a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the commercial theme market, which doesn’t always follow the same theme guidelines. The WordPress theme world has dug themselves a deep hole that they might not be able to get out of. The unfortunate aspect in all of this is that consumers are the ones who lose the most.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg Takes On New Role As CEO of Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14524\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:170:\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-takes-on-new-role-as-ceo-of-automattic?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=matt-mullenweg-takes-on-new-role-as-ceo-of-automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2498:\"<div id=\"attachment_14529\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leweb.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14524]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leweb.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: LeWeb 2010 \" width=\"849\" height=\"413\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14529\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTaqQozpbXs\">LeWeb 2010</a></p></div>\n<p>After celebrating his <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/\" target=\"_blank\">30th birthday</a> this weekend, Matt Mullenweg announced that he has accepted a new role as CEO of <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\" title=\"Automattic\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>. </p>\n<p>Toni Schneider joined Automattic as CEO eight years ago in January 2006 and has helped to expand Automattic&#8217;s reach to what he says is close to a billion people each month. But Schneider <a href=\"http://toni.org/2014/01/13/a-new-ceo-for-automattic/\" target=\"_blank\">isn&#8217;t saying goodbye</a>. He&#8217;s swapping roles with Matt who will now become the new CEO, as Matt announced in his <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> this morning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today we’re announcing publicly that Toni and I are switching jobs — he’s going to focus on some of Automattic’s new products, and I’m going to take on the role of CEO. Internally this isn’t a big change as our roles have always been quite fluid</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Matt if the new role would change his relationship and involvement with WordPress.org, but it turns out that it won&#8217;t bring too big of a change to his day-to-day. He replied, <strong>&#8220;No major changes planned, as things are working very well already.&#8221;</strong>  The business of Automattic, which was started to help make WordPress simple to setup and host, is entirely separate from the open source project. Its growth has mirrored the success of the open source software, with WordPress currently powering <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\" target=\"_blank\">21.2% of the web</a>. </p>\n<p>Congrats to both Matt Mullenweg and Toni Schneider on their new positions in Automattic. With their flagship product WordPress.com now <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-is-ranked-8-for-internet-traffic-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">ranked 8th for traffic in the US</a>, I&#8217;d say the two are working together quite successfully. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 18:33:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Matt: Toni Schneider &amp; Automattic CEO\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=43446\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2101:\"<p><a href=\"http://ma.tt/2006/01/automattic-toni/\">Eight years and one day ago I blogged about Toni Schneider joining Automattic as CEO</a>, as I said then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I first met Toni shortly after I moved to San Francisco and I&#8217;ve wanted him to be a part of Automattic pretty much since the idea first entered my mind. We&#8217;ve spent many long meals over the past year discussing the Automattic idea before it even had a name. I&#8217;ve been on cloud nine since (somehow) I convinced him to leave the incredibly cushy corporate job and rough it out in startup world again. I&#8217;m very very excited about some of the things coming down the line.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fast-forward roughly two thousand, nine hundred, and twenty-two days and I&#8217;m still on cloud nine and love working together with Toni. We have been through some incredible ups and downs in people, valuation, been on both sides of the table for acquisitions, and seen dozens of competitors come, go, and come again as the hyperactive tech news cycle loops back around.</p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing publicly that Toni and I are switching jobs &#8212; he&#8217;s going to focus on some of Automattic&#8217;s new products, and I&#8217;m going to take on the role of CEO.  Internally this isn&#8217;t a big change as our roles have always been quite fluid, and I&#8217;ve had some recent practice filling in for him for a few months last year when he was on sabbatical. I&#8217;ve learned a tremendous amount from Toni over the years and I&#8217;m looking forward to putting that into practice.</p>\n<p>Besides, it&#8217;s obvious that no one in their twenties should run a company.

The event will be a mini-conference and will focus on both BuddyPress and bbPress topics. The organizers plan to have beginner sessions alongside designer / developer presentations.

I&#8217;ve now managed to stay alive for three decades, thirty rotations around the sun, and I woke up this morning a little hungover (there’s a lot of tequila in Mexico) but with a huge grin on my face.</p>\n<p>In many ways life accumulates complexity as you get older, but the things that are most important are simple and universal: friends and loved ones, health, and working on something you enjoy and has an impact.

The development team then built a cPanel plugin on top of the API so hosting companies can easily plug ManageWP functionality into their hosting offers. </p>\n<p>Tina Kesova, SiteGround&#8217;s business development strategist, said that ManageWP services have significantly improved SiteGround customer satisfaction: &#8220;The great amount of signups and extremely fast adoption of ManageWP by our customers proves that it is a great solution for our clients&#8217; needs and adds great value to our service offering.&#8221; </p>\n<h3>Partnering with Hosts</h3>\n<p>Partnering with hosting companies is nothing new when it comes to integrating both free and commercial WordPress products. <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI</a>, the WordPress command line interface, comes <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hosting-companies-that-have-wp-cli-pre-installed\" target=\"_blank\">pre-installed</a> on many major hosting providers. Hosts also commonly integrate and/or recommend caching solutions, staging, GIT version control, as well as WordPress auto-installers.</p>\n<p>Prelovac said they are targeting more hosts for integration with ManageWP. &#8220;At this moment, we are looking for hosting companies that have great reputation as WordPress hosts. Of course we also have a lot of plans, including very close integration with hosting products and perhaps being a part of the ultimate WordPress hosting product in the near future,&#8221; he said. Though he would not offer more specifics, Prelovac anticipates the that more hosts will begin to see the value of integrating WordPress-related products. He predicts, &#8220;Given the popularity of WordPress, I expect that in the future ManageWP will become a standard on hosting panels similar to how CloudFlare is now, so that people who can really benefit from using our solution can do so more easily.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\" target=\"_blank\">W3techs</a>, <strong>WordPress currently powers 21.2% of the web</strong>. It&#8217;s a prudent move on the part of hosting companies to try to attract more WordPress users by adding WordPress-related tools to their control panels. </p>\n<p>With ManageWP successfully working its way into cPanels across SiteGround servers, do you think we&#8217;ll see more commercial WordPress products seeking hosting partnerships? This seems like a smart thing to do, especially if you offer WordPress backup services or anything related to migration and staging. If a host doesn&#8217;t already include generic options for these products and services, this is one easy way for the company to extend its capabilities.

Rather, it&#8217;s an adaptation or re-design of it, as the name suggests, with two important design distinctions: Ridizain is full width and centered. These major differences answer a couple of the most common complaints about Twenty Fourteen. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ridizain.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14397]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ridizain.jpg\" alt=\"ridizain\" width=\"880\" height=\"660\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14399\" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.wpstrapcode.com/ridizain/\" target=\"_blank\">Ridizain demo</a> and compare to the <a href=\"http://twentyfourteendemo.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Fourteen demo</a> to spot the differences between the two themes.</p>\n<p>Ridizain is built with the same template structure as Twenty Fourteen and maintains all of its other features, including featured homepage content, three widget areas, custom recent posts and full color control for many of the theme&#8217;s elements.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the developer will incorporate any major changes added to Twenty Fourteen in the future. If this is a concern for you, it might be better to simply create a child theme of Twenty Fourteen with the CSS changes included. This is a theme worth looking at if you&#8217;re a fan of Twenty Fourteen and want a quick way to get it centered and full width.

The project was originally created by <a href=\"https://github.com/andreascreten\" target=\"_blank\">Andreas Creten</a> and is now maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/scribu\" target=\"_blank\">Cristi Burcă</a> (Scribu) and other <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli?tab=members\" target=\"_blank\">contributors</a>. </p>\n<p>WP-CLI provides a command line interface for managing WordPress sites without having to use the admin screens. It makes many routine development tasks faster and easier, including updating the core and plugins, installing themes, backing up your database, managing user roles and so much more. A full list of <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/commands/\" target=\"_blank\">commands</a> is available on the project site and a list of <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/List-of-community-commands\" target=\"_blank\">community commands</a> is posted to github.</p>\n<h4>A List of Hosts With WP-CLI Pre-Installed</h4>\n<p>The project recently updated its github wiki to include a <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/List-of-hosting-companies\" target=\"_blank\">list of hosting companies</a> that support WP-CLI. This list includes hosts that have WP-CLI installed by default for their customers when they first SSH into their servers, meaning that the <code>wp</code> command is already available. Of course, you can always install it at any host where you have SSH access, but this list includes companies that have it pre-installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bluehost</li>\n<li>Dreamhost</li>\n<li>Synthesis</li>\n<li>SiteGround</li>\n<li>WordPress.com VIP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several of these hosts have additional resources to help you get started. Dreamhost has a <a href=\"http://wiki.dreamhost.com/WordPress_wp-cli\" target=\"_blank\">wiki for using WP-CLI</a> and SiteGround also has a <a href=\"http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/wp-cli.htm\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI tutorial</a>. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m surprised that there aren&#8217;t more managed WordPress hosts listed here, as it&#8217;s just one extra little perk for getting developers to sign up. If you represent a host that should be on this list, please edit the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/List-of-hosting-companies\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI hosting companies</a> wiki page to include your company. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 13:56:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WordPress Adds Per-Ticket Notifications to Trac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:158:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adds-per-ticket-notifications-to-trac?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-adds-per-ticket-notifications-to-trac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3562:\"<p>Andrew Nacin is on a roll with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements\" target=\"_blank\">adding improvements to the WordPress core trac</a>.

Today he <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/09/new-trac-notifications-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> per-ticket notifications, an exciting new feature that will help you stay updated on tickets. This is big news for WordPress core development.</p>\n<p>Directly above the &#8220;Add Comment&#8221; box you can now find a <strong>&#8220;Watch This Ticket&#8221;</strong> button with a star.

After 10 years there are millions of people around the world using this software and interacting with one another on a daily basis.  The vast majority of these interactions are positive and respectful and for a long time we haven&#8217;t needed any kind of official code of conduct, but this is changing. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Women in WordPress&#8221; is currently a hot button topic and has been for years, with many <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/summit/2012/11/16/summary-women-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">discussions</a> centered around how to make women feel more welcome. </p>\n<p>A few incidents of harassment have popped up in our community and other open source communities, prompting a movement to create a Code of Conduct or set of  <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/09/29/community-expectations/\">Community Expectations</a>. Jen Mylo is currently heading up the Community Expectations team that will create a first draft for everyone to review and send feedback on. In the meantime, how can the community handle situations on the front lines at WordCamps or other events where people are gathering?</p>\n<h3>Do We Need A Safety Officer At WordCamps?</h3>\n<p>Stephanie Leary posted on the Women of WordPress site concerning <a href=\"http://womenofwp.org/2014/01/how-to-report-harassment-at-wordcamps/\" target=\"_blank\">harassment at WordCamps</a> after speaking with a couple of people who experienced minor harassments at events but hadn&#8217;t reported it. She suggests that WordPress create its own harassment policy and that WordCamp organizers designate a safety officer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once we get to the after parties, the badges come off and the drunken propositions begin. It’s difficult to remember at that point who’s an organizer and who isn’t. Someone on the WordCamp staff needs to be designated as a Safety officer, and that person needs to be introduced at the opening remarks so everyone knows who it is. That person’s contact information needs to be on the Camp website so people can get in touch with him or her when needed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The question that naturally follows is: What should the safety officer or WordCamp organizer do if someone reports harassment at a WordCamp?  Should they be expected to police attendee behavior off-site?</p>\n<p>Even if these officers are in place, will WordCampers report incidents of harassment? What happens from there? If the expectation to handle these situations is placed on WordCamp organizers, they will need training for how to respond in different scenarios. Hopefully procedures will be included in the Community Expectations for how conference staff should respond to reports of harassment. </p>\n<h3>Why Harassment Commonly Goes Unreported</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14339\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/medium_8985496669.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14309]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/medium_8985496669.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: RebeccaBarray - cc\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14339\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebeccabarray/8985496669/\">RebeccaBarray</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>When I first started blogging I often received many unprofessional comments on my posts that had nothing to do with the content. I have been harassed in live chat support sessions and on Twitter, but those things rarely happen anymore. These issues have improved over the past five years that I&#8217;ve been involved with WordPress. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was harassed at my very first WordCamp by an attendee at an after-party. He was heavily pressuring me to go to his hotel room with him and used some crude phrases not fit for print, mixed in with: <strong>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, I know you want to f*** me.&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Your husband doesn&#8217;t have to know.&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;You know you want it.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>How could the conversation degrade so quickly from building websites to sexually explicit advances? I politely refused several times so as not to make a scene and then the conversation was dead. He apologized the next morning right before I was scheduled to speak in the BuddyPress track.</p>\n<p>As someone who is not a natural public speaker, I was already very nervous about my presentation. In my mind I was thinking, <em>&#8220;These developers know EVERYTHING about WordPress and BuddyPress. What am I even doing here?&#8221;</em>  But on top of that I was nervous that I might see in the audience the face of that guy who had just completely objectified me the night before. Being seen as an object compounded my existing lack of self-confidence and made me feel like a total fraud. I wanted to disappear. </p>\n<p>Everyone I spoke to about it afterwards told me there was nothing to be done and to just forget about it. They meant well. </p>\n<p>At the time I agreed that there was nothing to be done. The reality is that there was no code of conduct, no expectations for after-party behavior, no boundaries set by the organizers, through no fault of their own.  But even if there had been a safety officer, I don&#8217;t know if I would have reported it. I certainly didn&#8217;t want anyone to lose his job over a mistake for which he apologized.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of reasons why women and men choose to stay silent and not report these experiences, a few of which include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They don&#8217;t want to draw attention to themselves. </li>\n<li>They don&#8217;t want to appear to be weak or seeking pity.</li>\n<li>They&#8217;re afraid that somehow they may have invited the unwanted attention.</li>\n<li>They don&#8217;t want to rock the boat.</li>\n<li>They don&#8217;t want to be treated like a victim.</li>\n<li>They fear retaliation or legal action.</li>\n<li>They assume that others have had it much worse and they should just be grateful nothing serious happened.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even with a code of conduct in place and a safety officer on hand, it is often difficult for victims of harassment to find a good reason to report these kinds of incidents, especially if nothing technically criminal took place.  It&#8217;s not an easy problem to solve. To truly change behavior we need to look deeper at fostering a culture of respect.</p>\n<h3>Creating A Culture of Respect</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14342\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kids-hands-holding-plants.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14309]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kids-hands-holding-plants.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: africagreenmedia.co.za\" width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14342\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: africagreenmedia.co.za</p></div>\n<p>Community can make or break a project. A set of community expectations is the first step in laying a foundation for respectful behavior. I wish we didn&#8217;t need them, but we do. WordCamp-specific community expectations would also be helpful for communicating those values within the context of that event. Though there are many differing opinions about a WordCamp organizer&#8217;s responsibilities to attendees and speakers, I think we can all agree on doing more to highlight respect as one of our chief values. </p>\n<p>Respect means holding each other in high esteem and honoring each other. Giving and receiving respect isn&#8217;t something that anyone wants to have to enforce. Nobody is fond of excessive rules and regulations. It&#8217;s something that needs to be part of our culture. The underlying idea is to always approach people with the attitude of &#8220;<em>I respect you and I appreciate that you&#8217;re here</em>,&#8221; whether that&#8217;s in the forums, on Twitter, in IRC, or at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Respect is a learned behavior. When new people see it modeled they are more likely to perceive it as a cultural value that we hold. We need to learn to give it unconditionally. There shouldn&#8217;t be any <em>&#8220;If you respect me, then I will respect you.&#8221;</em> But rather, the idea is that we respect people. Period.  Not because of anything they&#8217;ve achieved or created or because they know how to spell WordPress with the camel case. Sometimes people are new and they are still learning. That applies to behavior, too. People aren&#8217;t born knowing how to be respectful at a WordCamp so we need to articulate what that means for us.</p>\n<h3>How does this translate practically when it comes to harassment?</h3>\n<p>I propose the following for WordCamps: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a clear code of conduct or policy for harassment and make it known at the event. Remind people that they or others will probably be drinking at after-parities but that we can still be professionals.</li>\n<li>Educate WordCamp organizers on how to respond to reports of harassment. More in-depth training may be required for this position.</li>\n<li>Look out for each other. If someone tells you about something that happened, help them find the appropriate channels for dealing with it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcsf.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14309]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wcsf-300x191.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: central.wordcamp.org\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" class=\"size-medium alignright wp-image-14329\" /></a>I think this is a good starting point for helping attendees and speakers feel more comfortable about attending WordPress-related events. If you&#8217;re one of those who wants more diversity and wants to see <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/encouraging-women-to-speak-at-wordcamps\" target=\"_blank\">more women speakers at WordCamps</a>, then creating a code of conduct for your event might be a big help. Andrea Middleton said that the first WordCamp she was aware of having a code of conduct was WordCamp SF 2011. The <a href=\"http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/about/code-of-conduct/\" target=\"_blank\">code of conduct</a> for that event was inspired by the OSBridge Conference and provides a good starting place for event organizers to use in setting expectations for community behavior.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that incidents like this are not representative of the WordPress community as a whole. I have rarely encountered finer, more generous people than those I&#8217;ve met through WordPress. Our community is full of kind, polite, welcoming and friendly people. In most of these minor incidents, it happens because someone didn&#8217;t know our unwritten code of conduct. (Or because somebody got wasted.) We can do a better job of communicating that at events.</p>\n<p>In the end, at WordCamps we all just want to laugh and enjoy our time learning from each other. There&#8217;s no way for WordCamp organizers to guarantee attendees and speakers that nobody will harass you or make you feel unwelcome. Embracing the risk of interacting with other human beings is part of being an adult. Organizers can, however, better educate themselves about what procedures they can follow if harassment is reported. Ultimately, they may not be able to do too much more than ask the person to leave, but the message will be loud and clear: </p>\n<p><strong>In the WordPress community we treat each other with respect.</strong> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Jan 2014

Mylo has <a title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/01/07/women-speakers-at-wordcamps/\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/01/07/women-speakers-at-wordcamps/\">published some interesting statistics</a> on the WordPress Community blog that show WordCamps still have a long way to go when it comes to women speaking at these events. Between 2012 and 2013, there was only a slight increase in the amount of women speaking at WordCamps. Possibly compounding the issue is that most of the events with dismal numbers had a large number of &#8220;<em>circuit</em>&#8221; speakers who were predominantly male. Circuit speakers are individuals who speak at multiple WordCamps during the year.</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Difficult Talking About This Subject As A Male</h3>\n<p>As a male, I feel like I have no business talking about matters such as these. I love the fact that the WordPress project and WordCamps in general encourage diversity. For example, WordCamp Miami clearly states on their <a title=\"http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/speakers/speaker-submissions/\" href=\"http://2014.miami.wordcamp.org/speakers/speaker-submissions/\">speaker submission page</a> their desire for a diversified group of presenters: &#8220;<em>Our general policy is that we don&#8217;t consider the race, sex, religion, or any other factor of the speaker to play a part in our selection process.&#8221;&nbsp;</em>If organizers are pressured to start selecting women speakers based on the fact that they are women, it would invalidate policies like the one referenced above.</p>\n<h3>Yay Or Ney To WordCamp Circuit Speakers?</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14281\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordPressCircuit.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14277]\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14281\" alt=\"WordPress Circuit\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WordPressCircuit-300x229.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of <a title=\"http://fuelyourcoding.com/getting-started-writing-wordpress-plugins/\" href=\"http://fuelyourcoding.com/getting-started-writing-wordpress-plugins/\">Fuel Your Coding</a></p></div>\n<p>Going back to the topic of circuit speakers which is very touchy, I think it&#8217;s important to remember what WordCamps are truly about. In their simplest form, they are WordPress meetups but on a bigger scale. WordCamps are highly encouraged to be made up of mostly local attendees. Most of these events have a set of dedicated volunteers that record sessions that are uploaded to <a title=\"http://wordpress.tv/\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> after the event. Thanks to WordPress.tv, one question I have is whether or not individuals should be discouraged from traveling to multiple WordCamps to give the same presentation? If that road is traveled, where does it lead? WordCamp Central placing limits on the amount of WordCamps a presenter can travel to and give the same presentation?</p>\n<h3>Starting With The Local WordPress Meetup</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_14284\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LocalWordPressMeetup.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14277]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14284\" alt=\"NEO WordPress Meetup January 24, 2013\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LocalWordPressMeetup.jpg\" width=\"544\" height=\"358\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">NEO WordPress Meetup January 24, 2013</p></div>\n<p>Since WordCamps are all about local first, that&#8217;s where any initiative encouraging diversity would have the largest and immediate impact. The local meetups I have attended have had almost a 50/50 mix of males to females. The women I&#8217;ve had a pleasure to help are usually brand new to WordPress and its ecosystem. I do my part by helping them out as best I can and then encourage them to be part of the larger community. If they decide to remain quiet and not take an active role in the WordPress community, what am I supposed to do? Push them into it?</p>\n<h3>New Study Shows Promising Results</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a male WordCamp organizer, consider having one or more women be part of the conference organization group. A <a title=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-easiest-possible-way-to-increase-female-speakers-at-conferences/282858/\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-easiest-possible-way-to-increase-female-speakers-at-conferences/282858/\">recent post by The Atlantic</a> highlights a study that shows having just one woman on the organizing committee for a conference greatly increases the likelihood of women appearing at the front of the room.</p>\n<h3>More Women Everywhere!</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m all for more women in tech, women in WordPress, women everywhere. I don&#8217;t like how some of them have gone about raising awareness of the issue because it seems more like a war between males and females. But WordPress has done a great job enabling people of any race, religion, etc to contribute to the project. Without forcing diversity on WordCamp organizers, what are they supposed to do if no women submit speaker applications?

Translating WordPress into a new language makes it possible for people around the world to take advantage of this open source publishing platform to make their voices heard. In addition to translations, some languages and cultures have different requirements for <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section\" target=\"_blank\">post meta data</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-parsidate/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-parsidate</a> is a relatively new plugin that was created to be a Persian package builder for WordPress. This plugin adds support for the Shamsi or Jalali Calendar, which is the traditional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar\" target=\"_blank\">Persian calendar</a> based on the sun. It rewrites dates in posts, comments, pages, archives, search, and categories to utilize the Shamsi calendar. WP-Parsidate also features the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shamsi (Jalali) date in Posts, comments, pages, archives, search, categories</li>\n<li>Shamsi (Jalali) date in Permalinks</li>\n<li>Shamsi (Jalali) date in admin sections such as posts lists, comments lists, pages lists</li>\n<li>Shamsi (Jalali) date in post quick edit, comment quick edit, page quick edit of admin panel</li>\n<li>Shamsi (Jalali) archive widget</li>\n<li>RTL and fixed tinymce editor</li>\n<li>Poweful and fast function for fixing Arabic (ي , ك) to Persian (ی , ک)</li>\n<li>Poweful and fast function for Persian numbers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, this plugin provides a better Persian language experience with WordPress. It has already received many five star ratings and positive reviews. I installed it just for fun and it&#8217;s amazing how it completely transforms the WordPress frontend and backend. This screenshot is from a test site where I didn&#8217;t even have the Persian translation active:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wp-persidate.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14275]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wp-persidate.jpg\" alt=\"wp-persidate\" width=\"1059\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14292\" /></a></p>\n<p>Though Persian-speakers may be a small portion of worldwide WordPress users, it&#8217;s quite inspirational to see a plugin that changes WordPress to present content in a better way for their language. If you have friends who blog in Persian, make sure to share the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-parsidate/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-parsidate</a> plugin with them.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Jan 2014 01:38:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Theme Friendly Helps You Find the Perfect WordPress Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=14224\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:178:\"http://wptavern.com/theme-friendly-helps-you-find-the-perfect-wordpress-theme?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=theme-friendly-helps-you-find-the-perfect-wordpress-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3420:\"<p>Hunting for a new WordPress theme can be an overwhelming task, given the sheer number of theme providers out there.

Mansfield then uses a subset of the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress theme review team guideline checks</a> when reviewing the themes in order to generate a quality score. He documents exactly how the theme got its score and records any additional information that might be useful for sorting, ie. theme type, feature support, layout options, plugin support, page templates available, translated languages, etc. This results in an excellent, detailed list of sorting options in the sidebar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/example-review.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[14224]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/example-review.jpg\" alt=\"example-review\" width=\"1210\" height=\"687\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14254\" /></a></p>\n<p>Visitors of the site can search themes by their own requirements and then read up on the quality score. Searching the site returns results sorted by quality score, rather than most recent submissions. The idea is that anyone shopping for a WordPress theme can make a more informed decision as a consumer, based on the review provided by Theme Friendly.</p>\n<p>Mansfield manually reviews each theme by the same criteria. He disclosed that he does in fact use affiliate links but that they do not in any way influence the theme reviews. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about his process in creating the site and the technical details behind it, check out his series on <a href=\"http://alexmansfield.com/projects/wordpress-theme-review-site-day-4\" target=\"_blank\">Creating a Commercial WordPress Theme Review Site</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://themefriendly.com/find-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Friendly</a> concept provides another helpful way for consumers to explore and purchase WordPress themes. If you like the idea of having a site where you can find professionally-reviewed themes, there are a few things you can do to help Mansfield expand his library. Drop him a note on his <a href=\"http://themefriendly.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">contact form</a> to let him know what is the most frustrating part of shopping for WordPress themes.

Pooria is using indiegogo to power the <a title=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wordpress-school-mooc\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wordpress-school-mooc\">WP School campaign</a>. The campaign contains a number of perks for those that contribute funds ranging from discounts to early access to course material. With <strong>33 days</strong> left to go, the campaign has raised <strong>$1,029</strong> of the <strong>$25,000 goal</strong>. According to the campaign description, the money would be used to purchase servers, provide an ad free experience, and provide a period of time to allow revenues to be generated to take the place of the initial campaign funds.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We have already made the main investment. Over the last two years we have been doing extensive research and development to plan this project. We have defined the education roadmap, skill levels and all the related knowledge and expertise. We have also developed many courses that will be offered from the first release.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pooria points out in the campaign text: &#8220;<em>Education is the wisest investment for any person or society</em>&#8220;. I couldn&#8217;t agree more. However, with sites like <a title=\"http://wpsessions.com/\" href=\"http://wpsessions.com/\">WPSessions.com</a>, <a title=\"http://wpmentor.org/\" href=\"http://wpmentor.org/\">WPMentor.org</a> and others, there seems to be no end to the amount of resources that are available for self-motivated learners to learn WordPress. Can something like WPSchool.org succeed in an online world where so much WordPress information is available for free?

With Chrome usage on the rise and now dominating the web, we&#8217;d like to highlight a few tools that will help WordPress users detect the software on websites as well as publish content directly from Chrome.</p>\n<h2>WordPress.com Extension</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpresscom-extension/pnbbfhcegldppmibabepjfjloachnmjb\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpcom.png\" alt=\"wpcom\" width=\"1280\" height=\"798\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14114\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpresscom-extension/pnbbfhcegldppmibabepjfjloachnmjb\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com Extension</a> is a free tool created by WordPress.com. It brings features from WordPress.com into your browser, including notifications, the ability to follow sites and start new blog posts instantly from your browser toolbar.</p>\n<p>The latest version of the extension displays notifications like other native notifications in Chrome. These can be configured in the extension&#8217;s preferences to show notifications that are the most useful to you and hide the others.</p>\n<h2>WordPress.org Plugins SVN Link</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpressorg-plugins-svn/nfhpbeacfmdhhlhmolfcdlknnmalnled\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/svn-link.png\" alt=\"svn-link\" width=\"1278\" height=\"793\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14116\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpressorg-plugins-svn/nfhpbeacfmdhhlhmolfcdlknnmalnled\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org Plugins SVN Link</a> fits in seamlessly with plugin pages. It&#8217;s something I use so often that I forget that it has been added by my browser. This extension does one simple thing: It adds a button linking to the plugin&#8217;s SVN repo under the .zip file download button on WordPress.org. This makes it super easy to explore the code of a plugin before you decide to install it.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Version Check</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpress-version-check/hbeikkjblcogpkdnchpffgefhkilodnn\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/version-checker.png\" alt=\"version-checker\" width=\"1280\" height=\"729\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14118\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpress-version-check/hbeikkjblcogpkdnchpffgefhkilodnn\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Version Check</a> provides a quick way to see what version of WordPress a site is running.

This extension is available in a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wordpress-version-check/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox version</a>. </p>\n<h2>Quick Switch for WordPress Accounts</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-switch-for-wordpres/nmdiilgiakfmmipnolamomicpaeddhpk/related\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/account-switcher.png\" alt=\"account-switcher\" width=\"1282\" height=\"796\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14120\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-switch-for-wordpres/nmdiilgiakfmmipnolamomicpaeddhpk/related\" target=\"_blank\">Quick Switch</a> for WordPress Accounts is a handy extension that lets you easily switch between accounts on your WordPress sites. If you have sites you maintain regularly where you&#8217;re always signing in and out of accounts, this extension could be a huge time saver for you.</p>\n<h2>Theme Sniffer</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/theme-sniffer/kihhefcbenhkjgjhchanjfhhflaojldn\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/theme-sniffer.png\" alt=\"theme-sniffer\" width=\"1400\" height=\"752\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14122\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/theme-sniffer/kihhefcbenhkjgjhchanjfhhflaojldn\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Sniffer</a> is a handy little extension that will tell you what theme a WordPress or Joomla site is using. During my tests, I found that it isn&#8217;t able to detect child themes. It will, however, correctly display the parent theme in use.</p>\n<h2>WP Write</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wp-write/ccihbopoacphplchahdeliepepbhjpbe\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpwrite.png\" alt=\"wpwrite\" width=\"1747\" height=\"1222\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14124\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wp-write/ccihbopoacphplchahdeliepepbhjpbe\" target=\"_blank\">WP Write</a> is a simple, browser-based client for WordPress. It uses XML-RPC to post to your WordPress site directly from Chrome, without you having to log into the admin. The extension supports WordPress.com blogs and self-hosted WordPress sites. It&#8217;s very handy for quickly saving ideas for posts as drafts while browsing but can also be used to format and publish posts.</p>\n<h2>Chrome Sniffer</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-sniffer/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae<br />\n\"><br />\n\"><br />\n\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/chrome-sniffer.png\" alt=\"chrome-sniffer\" width=\"1791\" height=\"1039\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14126\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-sniffer/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome Sniffer</a> is a useful extension if you often find yourself wondering what CMS a site is running.

You can add up to five WordPress sites to the settings, allowing you to quickly post to any of your favorite sites.</p>\n<h3>Something To Consider</h3>\n<p>If you install multiple WordPress-related Chrome extensions, please be advised that the developers quite often use the WordPress logo in the toolbar. In some cases you may have two or three WordPress logos in your toolbar with no distinction between them for what extension it launches. It&#8217;s best to select the extensions that will be the most useful for you instead of going crazy installing all of them. If you&#8217;re a Chrome extension developer who creates WordPress-related extensions, please consider using a more unique button design. </p>\n<p><strong>Which extensions are the most useful for your WordPress workflow?

Behind every amazing race car win you ever saw, there was a team of engineers and grease monkeys behind the scenes that fine-tuned the engine of the car to amazing precision and performance. Driving the efficiency beyond what the original manufacturers ever thought was possible. That&#8217;s what David Cramer can do with WordPress and the plugins he has created. </p>\n<p>He&#8217;s taken the stock 4 cylinder engine in your typical WordPress installation and given you the ability to drop in a super vortex V8 that can do things with shortcodes that you never thought were possible. We&#8217;re talking shortcodes within shortcodes here. The Tony Stark ARC reactor of aftermarket WordPress mods and the best part is, that Caldera Engine is a plugin that exports other plugins. It&#8217;s literally a <strong>Plugin Construction Kit</strong>.</p>\n<p>David is also an active contributor in the <a title=\"PODS Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/\" target=\"_blank\">PODS plugin</a>, which we will talk with him about on another night.

John James Jacoby posted on the BuddyPress blog to invite all users, developers and interested parties to weigh in on BuddyPress in the <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Survey</a>. </p>\n<p>Questions in the survey range from how many BuddyPress sites you&#8217;ve built to what kind of hosting you opt for, WordPress and BuddyPress versions in use on your sites, and plugins that you&#8217;re using with social network. The survey also delves deeper into user opinions on the best features of BuddyPress and how it can be improved.</p>\n<h3>A Plea For Reliable Spam Protection</h3>\n<p>One question in the survey asks what features you think should be added to BuddyPress. I found this one to be difficult to answer, given how robust the plugin already is for quickly launching a full-featured social network. BuddyPress already covers all the basics and it&#8217;s not easy to think of something that could be added that wouldn&#8217;t be better left to the realm of plugins. </p>\n<p>If I were to nail it down to the most pressing issue for the vast majority of BuddyPress users, then better spam protection built into the core is at the top of my wishlist. Better core support for combating spam or an officially supported plugin would make a world of difference to BuddyPress community administrators. There are several plugin options available for curbing spam signups, but the effectiveness for most of them is pretty much hit or miss. </p>\n<p>In addition to a reliable option for stopping spam users at the door, it would also be nice to be able to display trending or popular content more easily, based on favorites or most-commented activity. This feature would be beneficial for more active BuddyPress communities and would help to increase interaction on the most important activity items. Then again, something like this might be better left to plugin territory. </p>\n<p>Everyone has an opinion about BuddyPress. Will you make yours count? It only takes a few minutes to complete the survey. Don&#8217;t miss your chance to help shape BuddyPress core development in 2014. Your participation will help this software better serve the many communities it powers across the web.

Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2856\" style=\"margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0\" alt=\"about-modern-wordpress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2984\" alt=\"responsive\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2954\" alt=\"colors\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2967\" alt=\"themes\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789\" alt=\"The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage.

Try it out on different devices and browsers, see how it goes, especially the more complex pages like widgets or seldom-looked-at-places like Press This. Color schemes, which you can change on your profile, have also been spruced up.</li>\n<li>The dashboard homepage has been refreshed, poke and prod it.</li>\n<li>Choosing themes under Appearance is completely different, try to break it however possible.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a new default theme, Twenty Fourteen.</li>\n<li>Over 250 issues closed already.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given how many things in the admin have changed it&#8217;s extra super duper important to test as many plugins and themes with admin pages against the new stuff.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7\">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7\">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">on the make/core blog</a>.

Выбрав это азартное развлечение, Вы получите не только море положительных эмоций от игры, но и сможете пополнить свои денежные запасы значительным выигрышем. Великая цивилизация ацтеков издавна славилась своим богатством и щедростью. Целые золотые горы украшали подземелья и хранилища ацтеков, и ходят слухи, что их можно отыскать, отправившись в рискованное и полное азарта приключение. Доступный в онлайн казино игровой автомат Aztec Gold создан в лучших традициях классических аппаратов пирамиды. Имея при этом интересный и оригинальный сюжет, игра не оставит равнодушным никого, даже самого требовательного и опытного игрока.\r\n<center><h2>Играть в игровой автомат Aztec Gold в онлайн казино Вулкан бесплатно</h2></center>\r\nАцтек Голд – это пирамида, полная сокровищ.  В аппарате пять барабанов и девять контрольных линий, что подчёркивает классичность его игровой механики. Однако, главным отличием здесь являются разнообразные мини игры, созданные для того, чтобы игрок мог заработать дополнительные баллы, а при должном везении, даже выиграть главный предмет борьбы – джек-пот. К тому же, такие игры просто интересны и помогают игроку расслабиться.\r\nЕсли рассматривать их по порядку, то первой стоит уделить внимание бонусной игре DIAMOND BONUS. Здесь игроку предстоит по очереди открывать ячейки с изображенными на них бриллиантами и постараться не наткнуться на змею, которая может испортить всю игру.\r\nРиск-игра – это также весьма забавное развлечение, вызывающее массу азартных эмоций и позволяющее удваивать выигрыш игрока. Естественно, в случае неудачи, игрок лишается всего. А если же ему сопутствует везение – то игрок забирает двойной выигрыш. Всё просто. Чистый риск, который может щедро окупиться.\r\nМини игры выпадают при определённых комбинациях барабанов. Эти комбинации, а также  подробные правила игры в конкретный автомат, можно посмотреть в меню «справка».\r\n',	'Aztec Gold',	'',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'aztec-gold',	'',	'',	'2013-12-20 18:10:47',	'2013-12-20 14:10:47',	'',	0,	'http://5.135.36.35/?p=16',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Игровой автомат Fairy Land онлайн имеет девять контрольных линий, с помощью которых определяются комбинации барабанов.\r\n<center><h2>Играть в игровой автомат Fairy Land в интернет казино Вулкан бесплатно довольно легко!</h2></center>\r\nКак и любой другой игровой аппарат, Фейри Ленд предлагает игроку дополнительные развлечения, которые помогают зарабатывать очки в игре. Это всевозможные мини игры, бонусные игры и риск игра, позволяющая удвоить выигрыш.\r\nМини игры в Лягушке требуют особого внимания. Здесь всё продумано до мелочей. Отличная графика и игровая механика не дадут игроку скучать. В одной из мини игр лягушка должна прыгать по кувшинкам. Вроде ничего сложного, однако к выбору между пятью возможными вариантами стоит подходить тщательно, ведь под одной из кувшинок находится крокодил и прыгнув, лягушка попадёт прямо к нему в пасть.\r\nРиск игра здесь предлагает угадать карту нужного цвета. При удачном отгадывании игрок получает удвоение всех своих заработанных очков, в случае неудачи – теряет всё. Однако, на то она и риск игра, чтобы щекотать нервы и щедро одаривать тех, кому сопутствует удача.\r\n',	'Fairy Land',	'',	'publish',	'open',	'open',	'',	'fairy-land',	'',	'',	'2013-12-20 18:09:41',	'2013-12-20 14:09:41',	'',	0,	'http://5.135.36.35/?p=24',	0,	'post',	'',	0),

Компот – второе имя, из-за обилия фруктов, является живой классикой, ведь маркировка барабанов здесь выполнена в стиле лучших традиций игровых залов. Пять барабанов этого аппарата украшают сливы, вишни, арбузы, бананы, лимоны, апельсины- то есть все фрукты, известные бывалым азартным игрокам.

Бесплатные игровые автоматы Sizzling Hot – это отличный повод для ностальгии тех, кто когда-то был частым гостем игровых залов, а также возможность открыть для себя интересный игровой мир для новичков.

Для тех, кто ещё не пробовал себя в качестве азартного игрока, здесь доступен тестовый режим, который предусматривает игру на виртуальные ставки.

Вместо минимальных 3 барабанов и нескольких линий (от 1 до 9) здесь мы уже видим 5 барабанов и 20 игровых линий, давая таким образом посетителям казино онлайн увеличить свои шансы на крупный выигрыш. Это особенно важно в том случае, если вам захочется рискнуть и играть на деньги. Но и в игре бесплатно также интересно играть сразу на многих линиях, проверяя свое везение в азартных играх.\r\n\r\nДля того, чтобы выиграть в игровых автоматах Крези Фрут, нужно собрать хотя бы одну комбинацию из трех и более символов.

Если же интуиция вас подведет, то выигрыш аннулируется.\r\n\r\nКроме риск-игры этот слот может предложить еще бонусную игру, если вы соберете на игровом поле 3 символа с надписью Crazy Fruits. В таком случае вы увидите перед собой ячейки, в которых спрятаны фрукты с бонусами. Главное – не наткнуться на червяка, который прекратит бонус-игру.\r\n\r\nСлот Крейзи Фрут – игра азартная, но не стоит сразу делать большие ставки.

Все игроки без регистрации могут попасть в чудесный мир промасленной атмосферы, запчастей, инструментов, в мир, в котором, всегда приветливый автолюбитель, отдыхает после трудного дня, потягивает папироску и попивает пиво.\n<h2>Играть бесплатно или на деньги в интернет казино?</h2>\nВсе символы, которые появляются на барабанах слота Garage, связаны с автомобилем. У каждого из них свое значение и коэффициент умножения. Свечи зажигания, канистра с маслом и аккумулятор принесут увеличение первоначальной ставки в 10, 20 и 50 раз. Пять символов желтой тачки, огнетушителя, шестеренки с логотипом игры и ключей от мерседеса умножат ставку от 100 до 5000 раз. Именно шестеренка играет роль \"дикого\" символа и способна дополнять любые комбинации, делая их выигрышными.\n\nПосле каждой удачной комбинации на слоте Гараж, игрок может увеличить свой выигрыш, рискнув им в игре на удвоение. В ней очень простые правила, нужно выбрать из четырех закрытых карт одну, которая перекроет уже открытую дилером карту и победа вам гарантирована.\n\nВ игровом автомате Гараж несколько бонусных игр. Три деревянных ящика начинают одноименную бонусную игру. Игроку предстоит выбрать из пяти ящиков, тот, в котором спрятаны наиболее нужные инструменты, а сотрудник ГАИ, который может появиться в любой момент, прекращает бонусный раунд, но при этом все полученные бонусы за открытые предметы перейдут на ваш счет. Вторую бонус-игру называют «Замками». В ней игрок должен открыть дверь, закрытую на пять замков, правильно подобрав ключ к каждому из них и только тогда он получит супербонус - умножение ставки в 2000 раз!\n\nВ игровой автомат Гараж в онлайн казино можно играть на деньги или бесплатно, на кредиты, без регистрации, можно выиграть максимальную суму!. Но, главное - помните, что это только игра и относитесь к ней как к отличному способу развлечения!',	'Garage',	'',	'inherit',	'open',	'open',	'',	'97-autosave',	'',	'',	'2013-10-14 15:37:52',	'2013-10-14 11:37:52',	'',	97,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/97-autosave/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Однако, в отличие от многих других ресурсов-однодневок, одного взгляда на Casino-x.com достаточно для того, чтобы понять – перед вами серьезное казино с огромными перспективами. Уже сегодня оно предлагает своим посетителям огромный выбор игровых автоматов, а также вполне реальные бонусы и выигрыши.\r\n<h2>Привлекательный дизайн</h2>\r\nПриходя на игорный сайт впервые, любой игрок обращает внимание на его оформление. И, как показывают результаты опросов, именно от качества дизайна во многом зависит степень доверия посетителя к конкретному ресурсу.\r\n\r\nОбзор интерфейса Casino-x.com показывает, что он идеально адаптирован под нужды посетителей. Внешнее оформление достаточно простое и при этом интуитивно понятное. Выбранная синяя цветовая гамма не утомляет глаза, а крупные оранжевые кнопки позволяют игроку быстро находить нужные опции.\r\n\r\nВсю необходимую информацию – описания игровых автоматов, размеры приза и главного джекпота можно просмотреть на главной странице. При этом в Casino X она изменяется в режиме онлайн, то есть, посетитель каждую минуту может видеть самые свежие новости казино.\r\n<h2>Простота регистрации в Casino-x.com</h2>\r\nДля того чтобы стать полноправным участником казино и начать играть на реальные деньги, достаточно пройти краткую процедуру регистрации. Как подтверждают результаты краткого практического обзора, процесс регистрации занимает примерно пол минуты. Здесь не нужно заполнять длинные формы и выполнять запутанные действия. Во время регистрации от игрока требуется только ввести свой электронный адрес, после чего перейти по полученной гиперссылке.\r\n<h2>Широкий функционал</h2>\r\nКазино работает на базе программного обеспечения Microgaming, что также говорит о высоком статусе игорного заведения. Отзывы игроков подтверждают, что все эмуляторы в азартном заведении работают без сбоев и ошибок. Кроме того, новичкам перед реальной игрой предоставляется возможность опробовать демо-версию понравившегося слота. Попасть в виртуальный зал, чтобы сыграть в виртуальные деньги в «Казино-Х» можно всего в один клик. Для демо-игры регистрация не требуется.\r\n\r\nЕдинственное, что иногда упоминается в отзывах игроков в качестве недостатка – это зависимость работы симуляторов от скорости интернет-соединения. При медленном интернете автоматы имеют свойство «подтормаживать», однако эта наблюдается лишь при очень низком качестве связи. Учитывая же то, что современные интернет-провайдеры стараются даже при самых низких тарифах обеспечивать комфортное качество соединения, эта проблема мало кого коснется.\r\n<h2>Выводы</h2>\r\nОбзор всего вышесказанного позволяет сделать вывод, что Casino X является хоть и молодым, но достойным представителем рынка азартных заведений, который имеет все шансы в скором времени стать лидером отечественной игровой индустрии.',	'Casino X отзывы',	'',	'publish',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'casino-x-otzyvy',	'',	'',	'2013-10-31 16:36:09',	'2013-10-31 12:36:09',	'',	0,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/?page_id=122',	0,	'page',	'',	0),

И, как показывают результаты опросов, именно от качества дизайна во многом зависит степень доверия посетителя к конкретному ресурсу.\n\nОбзор интерфейса Casino-x.com показывает, что он идеально адаптирован под нужды посетителей. Внешнее оформление достаточно простое и при этом интуитивно понятное. Выбранная синяя цветовая гамма не утомляет глаза, а крупные оранжевые кнопки позволяют игроку быстро находить нужные опции.\n\nВсю необходимую информацию – описания игровых автоматов, размеры приза и главного джекпота можно просмотреть на главной странице. При этом в Casino X она изменяется в режиме онлайн, то есть, посетитель каждую минуту может видеть самые свежие новости казино.\n<h2>Простота регистрации в Casino-x.com</h2>\nДля того чтобы стать полноправным участником казино и начать играть на реальные деньги, достаточно пройти краткую процедуру регистрации. Как подтверждают результаты краткого практического обзора, процесс регистрации занимает примерно пол минуты. Здесь не нужно заполнять длинные формы и выполнять запутанные действия. Во время регистрации от игрока требуется только ввести свой электронный адрес, после чего перейти по полученной гиперссылке.\n\nШирокий функционал\n\nКазино работает на базе программного обеспечения Microgaming, что также говорит о высоком статусе игорного заведения. Отзывы игроков подтверждают, что все эмуляторы в азартном заведении работают без сбоев и ошибок. Кроме того, новичкам перед реальной игрой предоставляется возможность опробовать демо-версию понравившегося слота. Попасть в виртуальный зал, чтобы сыграть в виртуальные деньги в «Казино-Х» можно всего в один клик. Для демо-игры регистрация не требуется.\n\nЕдинственное, что иногда упоминается в отзывах игроков в качестве недостатка – это зависимость работы симуляторов от скорости интернет-соединения. При медленном интернете автоматы имеют свойство «подтормаживать», однако эта наблюдается лишь при очень низком качестве связи. Учитывая же то, что современные интернет-провайдеры стараются даже при самых низких тарифах обеспечивать комфортное качество соединения, эта проблема мало кого коснется.\n\nВыводы\n\nОбзор всего вышесказанного позволяет сделать вывод, что Casino X является хоть и молодым, но достойным представителем рынка азартных заведений, который имеет все шансы в скором времени стать лидером отечественной игровой индустрии.',	'Casino X отзывы',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'122-revision',	'',	'',	'2013-10-31 16:35:50',	'2013-10-31 12:35:50',	'',	122,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/122-revision/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Игровые автоматы Мега джек – это азартные развлечения на любой вкус. Здесь доступно два основных варианта игры: на деньги и тестовый режим. Игра на деньги в особом представлении не нуждается, ведь именно с ней и связано само понятие азартных игр. Игроки со стажем оценят преимущества и большие выигрыши, которые доступны в данном режиме игры.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><h2>Играть в игровые автоматы Мега Джек на деньги в интернет казино Вулкан</h2></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Режим тестирования был разработан специально для новичков, в так называемых, рекламных целях. Он позволяет в полноценном игровом режиме ознакомиться с принципами и правилами игры.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Игровой аппарат онлайн имеет пять, реже три игровых слота, при вращении которых образуются определённые комбинации, которые могут пополнять кошелёк игрока или открывать дополнительные игровые возможности. Все выигрышные комбинации, а также основные правила игры представлены в меню «справка».</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Мини игры, открываемые посредством комбинаций на слотах, могут быть направлены на удвоение выигрыша или на получение дополнительных баллов в игре. Каждая из них является в своём роде уникальной, и не повторяется в других слотах. Основная часть мини игр опирается на основную идею игрового аппарата, дополняя общую игровую атмосферу. \r\nЗдесь игроку предлагается играть за лягушку, чей путь лежит через шаткие кувшинки со скрытыми опасностями или за отважного скалолаза, который должен добраться до вершины, опираясь исключительно на интуицию. Вариантов много, а единственное, что их объединяет – это обязательное чувство азарта, доступное так же в <a href=\"/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/\">игровых автоматах Гейминатор</a>.</p>',	'Мега Джек',	'',	'publish',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'mega-jack-igrovye-avtomaty',	'',	'',	'2013-12-20 18:17:12',	'2013-12-20 14:17:12',	'',	0,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/?page_id=147',	0,	'page',	'',	0),

Как и большинство игр, поначалу они предусматривали некоторое скопление людей за игровым столом, которые производили ставки, формируя коллективный банк. В  конце игры все выставленные деньги отходили к одному из игроков, который в данном случае был самым матёрым и удачливым. С развитием передовых технологий появились азартные игровые автоматы, которые доступны в системе <a href=\"/avtomaty-v-casino/\">автоматы в казино</a> совершенно бесплатно и без регистрации. Принцип игры в большинстве случаев остался тот же: делая ставки, игроки формируют коллективный банк, который стремительно растёт, а после,  став джек-потом, обрушивается на плечи внезапного счастливчика. Поначалу азартные <a href=\"/igrovye-avtomaty-vulcan/\">игровые автоматы Вулкан</a> были доступны в игровых залах, но с развитием интернет технологий перекочевали на просторы сети. </p>\n<center><h2>Современные онлайн казино и азартные игровые автоматы только у нас.</h2></center>\n<p>Во-первых, позволяя играть в азартные игры совершенно бесплатно без регистрации, смс, они отличаются максимальной доступностью. Любой пользователь может играть в любимые приложения в круглосуточном режиме. К тому же, большая пропускная способность подобных вещей позволяет играть за одним аппаратом нескольким людям одновременно, что в свою очередь  стимулирует быстрый рост коллективных банков. Таким образом, сумма джек-пота набегает быстрее, а сам джек-пот, соответственно, быстрее находит своего счастливого обладателя.</p>\n<p>Благодаря азартным играм в комфортных домашних условиях, игрок застрахован от зависимости и привыкания к игре, что доказано как учёными, так и многочисленными игроками по всему миру.</p>\n<p>Игра доступна как в классическом режиме «на деньги», так и в тестовом, созданном специально для новичков. В данном случае, любой новичок может ознакомиться с правилами игры, изучить её принципы и особенности игровой механики, совершенно ничем не рискуя. А после, почувствовав уверенность в собственных силах и везении, приступить к настоящим азартным  играм со смелыми ставками и большими выигрышами.</p>',	'Азартные игры',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'138-revision',	'',	'',	'2013-11-13 15:49:48',	'2013-11-13 11:49:48',	'',	138,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/138-revision/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Даже самый подверженный азарту человек может завершить игру в любой момент, ведь он находится дома и манящая атмосфера зала его не «держит». \r\n\r\n<center><h2>Игровой автомат Crazy Monkey без регистрации в интернет казино. Играйте прямо сейчас!</h2></center>\r\n\r\nКрейзи Манки – это качественный эмулятор классического игрового аппарата. Здесь присутствует знакомая многим маркировка слотов и система комбинаций. Однако, настоящим сюрпризом для игрока может стать система мини игр, которые направлены, главным образом, на щедрые бонусы и возможность «снять» главный джек-пот. К тому же, их оригинальность поможет разрядить игровую атмосферу и заинтересовать игрока простым, но увлекательным игровым процессом.\r\n\r\nСетевые онлайн казино характеризуются большой отдачей для игрока, как моральной, так и материальной. Система быстрого роста коллективных банков обусловлена высокой пропускной способностью игрового сайта, позволяющей играть за одним аппаратом нескольким игрокам подряд. Таким образом, и джек-поты гораздо быстрее находят своих счастливчиков. \r\nМартышки – это отличное развлечение для тех, кто ценит классику в новой обработке.\r\n',	'Crazy Monkey',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'1-revision-10',	'',	'',	'2013-12-18 00:51:17',	'2013-12-17 20:51:17',	'',	1,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/1-revision-10/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Достаточно зайти на страничку понравившегося казино и слот Lucky Haunter порадует своей незабываемой атмосферой, причем абсолютно бесплатно.\r\n\r\nКак это работает?В отличие от других слотов с возможностью играть бесплатно , наслаждаться пьянящей атмосферой вы сможете сиюминутно без регистрации, нажав кнопку Старт и, решившись, играть до победного.

Вы получите выплаты, в соответствии с таблицей. Важно помнить: чем больше одинаковых символов, тем больше приз.

Кроме того, если на линии 5 бананов вы получаете джекпот, увеличивающий вашу ставку в 9 тысяч раз. Что будет особенно важно при игре на деньги, так как выигрыш составит целое состояние!

А вот Магический шар является символом \"разброса\", в случае выпадения трех, или более таковых на барабане, запускает призовую игру, которая дает пятнадцать бесплатных вращений. Представьте себе, сколько кредитов может насыпаться вам просто так.\r\n\r\nИ теперь самое главное! По окончанию игры все вами выигранное умножается в два раза. Особенно этот слот будет по вкусу тем, кто постоянно окружает себя разнообразными символами удачи. Регистрируйтесь в интернет казино, чтобы начать на деньги.

Он, вполне заслуженно, входит в десятку самых известных и популярных слотов среди геймеров на территории стран СНГ. С переходом игорного бизнеса в Интернет, игровой автомат Гараж стал доступен в любом интернет казино, а благодаря тому, что теперь можно играть бесплатно, его популярность только возрастает. Все игроки без регистрации могут попасть в чудесный мир промасленной атмосферы, запчастей, инструментов, в мир, в котором, всегда приветливый автолюбитель, отдыхает после трудного дня, потягивает папироску и попивает пиво.\r\n<h2>Играть бесплатно или на деньги в интернет казино?</h2>\r\nВсе символы, которые появляются на барабанах слота Garage, связаны с автомобилем. У каждого из них свое значение и коэффициент умножения. Свечи зажигания, канистра с маслом и аккумулятор принесут увеличение первоначальной ставки в 10, 20 и 50 раз. Пять символов желтой тачки, огнетушителя, шестеренки с логотипом игры и ключей от мерседеса умножат ставку от 100 до 5000 раз. Именно шестеренка играет роль \"дикого\" символа и способна дополнять любые комбинации, делая их выигрышными.\r\n\r\nПосле каждой удачной комбинации на слоте Гараж, игрок может увеличить свой выигрыш, рискнув им в игре на удвоение. В ней очень простые правила, нужно выбрать из четырех закрытых карт одну, которая перекроет уже открытую дилером карту и победа вам гарантирована.\r\n\r\nВ игровом автомате Гараж несколько бонусных игр. Три деревянных ящика начинают одноименную бонусную игру. Игроку предстоит выбрать из пяти ящиков, тот, в котором спрятаны наиболее нужные инструменты, а сотрудник ГАИ, который может появиться в любой момент, прекращает бонусный раунд, но при этом все полученные бонусы за открытые предметы перейдут на ваш счет. Вторую бонус-игру называют «Замками». В ней игрок должен открыть дверь, закрытую на пять замков, правильно подобрав ключ к каждому из них и только тогда он получит супербонус - умножение ставки в 2000 раз!\r\n\r\nВ игровой автомат Гараж в онлайн казино можно играть на деньги или бесплатно, на кредиты, без регистрации, можно выиграть максимальную суму!.

Великая цивилизация ацтеков издавна славилась своим богатством и щедростью. Целые золотые горы украшали подземелья и хранилища ацтеков, и ходят слухи, что их можно отыскать, отправившись в рискованное и полное азарта приключение.

К тому же, такие игры просто интересны и помогают игроку расслабиться.\r\nЕсли рассматривать их по порядку, то первой стоит уделить внимание бонусной игре DIAMOND BONUS. Здесь игроку предстоит по очереди открывать ячейки с изображенными на них бриллиантами и постараться не наткнуться на змею, которая может испортить всю игру.\r\nРиск-игра – это также весьма забавное развлечение, вызывающее массу азартных эмоций и позволяющее удваивать выигрыш игрока. Естественно, в случае неудачи, игрок лишается всего. А если же ему сопутствует везение – то игрок забирает двойной выигрыш. Всё просто.

Играйте в любой время из любой точки планеты, в самые лучшие бесплатные игровые аппараты. Несмотря на погоду за окном, Вы всегда можете получить качественное азартное развлечение, не выходя из дома. Учёными доказано, что такой подход к азартной игре совершенно не вызывает привыкания и игровой зависимости. Находясь дома, игрок может без труда контролировать игровой процесс, вовремя начинать и завершать его.</p>\r\n<p>Во-вторых, заведения, предлагающие игровые аппараты, характеризуются быстрым ростом коллективных банков, что способствует большему числу счастливчиков, которым удалось «сорвать» главный джек-пот. </p>\r\n<p>В-третьих, система характеризуется абсолютной честностью по отношению к игрокам бесплатных игровых аппаратов. </p>\r\n<p>Являясь своего рода живой классикой, такие развлечения имеют три или пять игровых барабанов и девять линий. С помощью линий определяются контрольные зоны, по которым считывается выигрыш по итогам вращения барабанов. </p>\r\n<p>В самом начале игры, игроком определяются контрольные линии и делается ставка, после чего он должен запустить барабаны. Останавливаясь, барабаны формируют определённые комбинации при помощи нанесенных на их поверхность рисунков. Если комбинация выигрышна – игроку начисляются соответствующая сумма денег или открываются бонусные игры, в которых можно удвоить выигрыш или же и вовсе получить самый главный приз в игровых аппаратах. </p>\r\n<p>Ознакомиться с комбинациями, а также с основными правилами <a href=\"/slot/\">слотов</a> можно в меню «help». </p>',	'Игровые аппараты бесплатно',	'',	'inherit',	'closed',	'closed',	'',	'143-revision-3',	'',	'',	'2013-12-20 18:15:03',	'2013-12-20 14:15:03',	'',	143,	'http://BESPLATNO-IGROVIE-AVTOMATI.COM/gaminator-igrovye-avtomaty/143-revision-3/',	0,	'revision',	'',	0),

Игрок может попасть в сказочное королевство или таинственный лес, или же стать разведчиком, вскрывая сейфы и ведя тихую войну против коварного и хитрого врага. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Несмотря на то, что все игровые аппараты построены по одной концепции, игровые возможности, которые они могут предоставить, чрезвычайно разнообразны.
